Elesa Britus Yakubu explained that it is obvious that the need of Nigerian can not be meet through continuous use of old way of cultivation and there is need to moved from old way of cultivation to the mechanization farming in Nigeria to meet the demand of Nigeria as well as food security in the country.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Once farmers have mastered oyster production, they can easily understand more advanced procedures on growing other mushroom types.”<br /><br />One of the participants at the training workshop, Pastor Sunday Oyewo, while speaking with the Nigerian Tribune, said:”I have been able to acquire a lot of knowledge as regards mushroom cultivation and I believe that the technical information I have gotten here would in no small measure help me when I start my mushroom farming.”<br /><br /><b>By: Nurudeen Alimi</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

This modest contribution of MAAN if complemented by large scale Maize grain users, will comfortably create more than one million on and off-farm employment in the maize sector alone”.<br /><br />“Therefore, request for an actual importation of maize grain in any form is considered counterproductive to the agricultural development of Nigeria and should be discouraged in its entirety.<br /><br />“Private entities hoping to continuously use Maize in large quantity should therefore be desirous of partnering and contributing to ongoing government efforts in agricultural development”, Abubakar added.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

We are still far away from practicing agriculture the way it supposed to and that is why AIRDEF has come together to start sensitising and teaching people, talking to people about doing agriculture in the right way.

    "content": "The Edo State Governor, Mr. Godwin Obaseki, has concluded plans to unveil 21 smallholder farmers’ cooperatives across the state, which will benefit from innovative models and funding from the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL).<br /><br />&nbsp;The governor disclosed this when he launched the Farm Aggregation Model for Smallholder Agriculture based on Technology (FAM-SMART) at Ossiomo Industrial Park in Benin City, Edo State.<br /><br />He said his administration intends to achieve its promise to create 200,000 jobs for Edo people through initiatives such as FAM-SMART, noting, “We have prepared ourselves as a government, waiting for opportunities of this nature.<br /><br />We had certain challenges which you have now taken care of, particularly on how to manage these geo-cooperatives of smallholders into clusters, how to provide the technology and the mechanisation, all of these you brought in one package.”<br /><br />“Before the end of the year, we want to have a workshop with NIRSAL and launch 21 geo-cooperatives across the state.<br /><br />I will call on local government chairmen across the 18 local government areas to establish one geo-cooperative each in their local government areas.<br /><br />The state government would have three, one in each of the three senatorial districts,” he added. Obaseki assured that land would be provided, as farmers would be motivated and trained and linked to off-takers. He said the geo-cooperatives would be adequately funded, adding,<br /><br />“We are very happy and excited with this pilot, which demonstrates that by using technology, financing and putting the whole value chain together, we can compete with others across the world.<br /><br />“I want to assure you that you have a partner in Edo State Government and we understand what you are trying to achieve and ready to commit resources to working with you to make sure we achieve food sufficiency and provide raw materials for the industries we are trying to attract into the state.”<br /><br />The Managing Director, NIRSAL, Aliyu Abdulhameed, said FAM-SMART is rural-based, market-led and technology-driven system of primary agriculture production designed by NIRSAL for smallholder farmers that relies on three principles, adding that “Agriculture in the Ossiomo Industrial Park encompasses the pre-upstream and upstream.

But there are other problems we have. There are food sellers in Nigeria who use calcium carbide to ripen bananas, mangoes and avocado pears and this is not good for our health.<br /><br />“What we see now is the use of Sniper and they say it damages the lungs if it is put in your food. We also have weevil control in beans and people use aluminium phosphate. We have other challenges like the preservation of chicken with formaldehyde, particularly smuggled chicken from across the borders.”<br /><br />He added, “So we are really in a crisis, but the big problem is how do we get people to know that this is bad? We here will understand very easily. Downstream where the farmers and small buyers are, they just don’t know.<br /><br />“No human being is safe in an environment like this because when they cook the beans you don’t know where it came from, you don’t know how much Sniper is in it.”<br /><br />The minister told officials from the various agencies that they must work together to educate Nigerians on why some chemicals must not be used for the preservation of agricultural produce.<br /><br />“At the end of this meeting, we have to develop a very strong strategy and committee for reaching farmers, fabricators, buyers and so on, everywhere,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By: Okechukwu Nnodim,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

One is to continuously make it an annual event and a platform to attract foreign investment, explore the economic and Agricultural potential of Nsukka people and Enugu State.<br /><br />“It has become an avenue for us to increase economic and commercial activities in this part of the world.”<br /><br />Explaining further, the Director-General said, “There are a lot of things we want to do differently this year. We are looking at exportable Agricultural produce.<br /><br />“Some of the participants are into palm oil and honey packaging. Part of what we are doing is to see if we can get these exportable Agricultural products and prepare them for export.<br /><br />“We are building an international coalition for this. We have already identified about fifteen exportable products and fortunately for us, these products are found abundantly in Nsukka and Enugu State.<br /><br />He stressed that, “Another thing that makes this year event special is that we are combining it with First Nsukka Beer/Malt carnival. We want to make an opportunity for people to buy household items for Christmas at a reduced price.<br /><br />“Two big beer/Malt producers are coming for the fair and three products will be sold at a very reduced price.”<br /><br />The Director-General debunked the allegation that goods and services at Nsukka trade fair are usually expensive but said that goods and services at the fair at reduced price.<br /><br />He, however, enjoined all the local manufacturers and indeed all people of Nsukka and beyond to participate in the fair which kicks off from December 6 to 17 at the usual venue, Government field, Nsukka.

    "content": "The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, wednesday expressed disappointment over what he described as high interest rate on loan facilities for farmers in the country.<br /><br />Speaking during the signing of Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Nigerian Agricultural Mechanisation and Equipment Leasing Company (NAMEL) , Tractor Owners and Operators Association of Nigeria (TOOAN) as well as the Tractor Owners and Hiring Facilities Association of Nigeria (TOHFAN), under the Private Sector Driven Mechanisation Programme (PSDMP), he noted the high rates had proven to be unfriendly to agricultiral production and a major discouragement to farmers.<br /><br />But, he assured that the ongoing reforms in the Bank of Agriculture (BoA) would soon be completed to allow Nigerian farmers enjoy low interest rate on loans and become shareholders in the bank. The Minister described the project as a good innovation which should not be allowed to die.<br /><br />He added that one of the policy thrusts of President Buhari’s administration was to leverage agriculture to bring life into the rural areas.<br /><br />He said:“The Memorandum of Understanding that we are signing today is one of the greatest innovation in Agricultural Sector because government cannot manage tractors, with the experience of so many years the tractors never last, they were supposed to last for 15 years but due to poor handling they only last for two or three years.”<br /><br />Ogbeh said government had no capacity to manage tractors, bur commended NAME and other stakeholders for their support and expressed the Federal government’s commitment to give the service providers necessary support to grow and provide quality services for farmers.<br /><br />However, Chief Executive NAMEL, Dr. Ahmed Adekunle noted that the partnership between it and the Mechanisation Service Providers (MSP) would not only provide equipment to farmers but also build local capacity to operate, maintain and maximize their uses ; he promised that the partners would remain committed and change the narrative of mechanization in the country.<br /><br />He said NAMEL in collaboration with Heavy duty Equipment Giant Mantrac would soon launch a nationwide Integrated Agricultural Land Development Scheme (INALDs) to open more lands on a flexible payment term.<br /><br /><b>By: James Emejo&nbsp;</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Dr Yemi Popoola, a&nbsp; Livestock Specialist at the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training (IAR&amp;T), Ibadan, says snail farming is a very profitable means of livelihood.<br /><br />Popoola told our reporters on Wednesday in Ibadan that Nigerians ought to explore snail farming as the Federal Government was now promoting the diversification of the economy.<br /><br />The expert noted that snail breeding could yield a quick profit if the farmers understood the essentials of modern techniques and focused on the species in high demand in Nigeria.<br /><br />According to him,&nbsp; snail farming requires less capital and space compared to poultry and pig farming while the management practices are simple.<br /><br />“Snail farming could be practiced as secondary occupation because it requires less time to maintain while&nbsp; their feed is cheap and can be locally sourced.<br /><br />“ These include leaves, tubers, vegetables as well as farm and household wastes.<br /><br />“Snail also has a great market all over the country and in the West African sub-region.<br /><br />“Domestic snail farming in Nigeria can meet up the family nutritional demands. Commercial snail production can decrease the importation of frozen meat or fish from foreign countries.<br /><br />‘’This can save money and make the economy of Nigeria strong,” he said.<br /><br />He advised snail farmers to take advantage of the seasonality of its market to gain premium prices for their snails.<br /><br />“Target the high-end customers,&nbsp; hotels, restaurants and households which can afford to pay a premium for a steady supply of the product.<br /><br />“If you supply all year round, you are likely to earn less during the rainy season when supply is in abundance and more in the dry season when the product is scarce.<br /><br />“You can buy cheaply from research institutes, farmers and other remote areas while the supply is high during the rainy season.<br /><br />“ You should maintain a healthy stock of large snails that you can sell to your customers when supply falls in the dry season.<br /><br />“But to achieve this, there is a very important condition. The size of your snails must be large and intimidating enough to command a high price.<br /><br />“For this to happen, you must start your snail farming with the right species—the&nbsp; Giant African land snails.<br /><br />“ You must ensure proper breeding, stocking, mulching and feeding practices to achieve the huge size that will make you a highly sought after supplier,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By: Adeyinka Akintunde&nbsp;</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The National President of the Poultry Association of Nigeria (PAN), Mr. Ezekiel Ibrahim, has disclosed that the poultry industry can drive the nation’s economy if government gives more attention to the industry in the areas of policies formulation and implementation.<br /><br />Ibrahim said this at the opening ceremony of 8th edition of the Nigeria Poultry Show tagged “Abeokuta 2018” with the theme: “Repositioning the Nigeria Poultry: Path to Economic Recovery and Growth Plan”, held in Abeokuta, the Ogun State capital, last Tuesday.<br /><br />He appreciated the federal government for the support given to the industry so far for it to attain its present status, however, insisted that more assistance from the government would further help the industry in boosting local and foreign investments.<br /><br />The PAN president explained further that the nation’s poultry industry had the capacity to be the export hub of poultry products to the West Africa sub-region.<br /><br />Time for border walls<br />“The Nigeria economy is on the path to more growth, and one way that the government can have a more win-win situation is by focusing attention on the poultry industry.<br /><br />“The poultry industry as the main supplier of cheap protein source of egg and meat cut across all the segment and objectives of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The industry as a complete private sector driven economy have the potential to drive the Nigeria economy both locally and internationally,”he added.<br /><br />He advised poultry farmers to protect their farms investments against any outbreak of poultry diseases, especially Avian Influenza (AI), since the FG had resolved not to compensate farmers for any outbreak of AI and other major poultry disesases.<br /><br />The vice president of PAN, South West, Olabode Adetoyi, called on the federal government to secure the nation’s borders against importation of poultry products so as to encourage local meat consumption.<br /><br />He further said Nigeria’s poultry industry lead in egg production in Africa with the production of 1 billion eggs annually.<br /><br />Adetoyi&nbsp; identified lack of access to agricultural lending with the focus of increasing farmers profits, multiple taxation and multiple regulations, smuggling of frozen products, raw materials, sub-standard inputs as some of the challenges confronting the industry.<br /><br /><b>Source: Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Scientists have warned that that food crisis may be&nbsp; imminent in Nigeria&nbsp; if the country fails to deploy innovation and technology into its food industry to boost productivity and sufficiency.<br /><br />The food safety experts who raised the alarm listed the country’s rising population amidst huge technology gaps, lack of enabling environment for researchers, inadequate funding for research, high processing losses and lack of sustainable policy as factors that could negatively impact on the lives of the people, if nothing is done urgently.<br /><br />They argued that with continuous increase in Nigeria’s population without innovation and technology in the food industry amongst others would certainly lead to food crisis.<br /><br />The food scientists, under the auspices of Nigerian Institute of Food Science and Technology, NIFST, gave the warning during the just-concluded 42nd Conference and Annual General Meeting, AGM, of the institute, held recently in Abeokuta, Ogun State.<br /><br />Speaking on the theme of the conference, titled:“Innovations in Food Science and Technology for Sustainable Economic Growth”, Director, Department of Bioresources Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada, Prof. Michael Ngadi said Nigeria must be adequately prepared against any possible outbreak of food crisis through innovative and creative ideas.<br /><br />Ngadi, who was represented by Prof.&nbsp; Akindele Alonge of the Department of Agriculture and Food Engineering, University of Uyo, said innovations and creativity were needed to achieve zero hunger in the country and also address the severe food insecurity looming in Africa.<br /><br />Calling for robust investment in research, the keynote speaker revealed that many children would die of starvation if not addressed, adding that it would be extremely difficult to feed children by 2050. “It has been projected that by 2050, the world’s population will be 9.6 billion people and Nigeria will be the third largest country in the world after India and China.<br /><br />And there are three basic issues that will affect the world if care is not taken and solutions not proffered. These issues are food, energy and water. Now, food comes first among the three issues especially in Nigeria and some other African countries.<br /><br />So, there is need for us to be active in terms of innovative ideas and technologies that can help boost food production and sufficiency in the country. Otherwise, we would have serious problem on our hands,” he said.<br /><br />Declaring the conference open, Vice Chancellor, Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB), Ogun State, Prof. Felix Salako, said agriculture is now about technology and value addition, and no longer about hoe and cutlass.<br /><br />Citing the robust researches carried out in cassava by Nigerian scientists and their potential benefits to the food industry, Salako noted that scientists in the country have a lot to offer if given the right and enabling environment to operate.<br /><br />The 42nd conference which witnessed various paper presentations on new discoveries in food production, processing and packaging, produced Mr. Toye Oluwole as the 22nd National President of NIFST, who promised to bring innovation into the food industry and also move the institute forward during his tenure. In his acceptance speech, Oluwole said: “We will develop programmes to tackle the gap between the food industry and the academia..”<br /><br /><b>By Chioma Obinna&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

But you can see that it is going to be wasted if we do not transplant them very soon.” “They have given us the inputs but refused to release the money they promised to help us plant. If we do not plant this rice seeds we would be wasting over 1.5million tons of rice. That will not be encouraging to our farmers in Akwa Ibom.<br /><br />“They promised to give us money for clearing and planting because due to our terrain, ploughing and harrowing are done manually unlike in the North. Here you can see the heavy grass/weeds. That is why we were happy when we were told that we would be given the money for us to clear and till the soil, unfortunately we have not been given the money till now”, he added We can’t repay loan if we don’t plant —Ekanem<br /><br />Another rice farmer, Mr. Ubong Ekanem of Heritage Builders, Itukho Multi Purpose Cooperative, told NDV: “We are worried because the inputs we were given are not free. We are expected to refund the federal government after harvesting. So if we do not plant, how are we going to pay back the loan? “This is our main concern. We embraced the scheme but if we do not get the money to cultivate, then the scheme would not have been fair to us,” he explained.<br /><br />&nbsp;A’Ibom RIFAN chair in dilemma Contacted, state chairman of RIFAN, Prof Etim Ituen said, “We have severally written to the national president of RIFAN and during the flag off of the programme in the state, Unity Bank, the anchor was there and they said that they were going to open account for the farmers because they promised they were going to give the farmers money for cultivation and the farmers were happy.”<br /><br />&nbsp;“But when approached, the Unity Bank said it later got a letter from its headquarters that they should not release any money to the farmers. And when I called the national secretary, he said that they do not give money to farmers and that they should continue to plant. This money is included in the economy of production.

The numerous plants, vegetation and herbs are created for a purpose by God.<br /><br />“Protein, vitamins and minerals can be sourced from some plants and herbs. Many nations in the world take to herbal products (vitamins) to raise animals and they are result orientated.<br /><br />“We need not to depend on everything foreign, borrowed and bought technology. We have available local raw materials that can replace imported livestock inputs. Unfortunately, we have failed to work on many locally available seeds, fruits and vegetation.”<br /><br />He advised fresh agriculturists to know that the race to success started after graduation from school, saying they needed to work hard and practise what they learnt in school.<br /><br />He said agriculture was a lucrative venture that could take them from poverty to wealth, but he stressed that it required hard work and dedication.<br /><br />The Acting Dean of the Faculty of Agriculture, Bowen University, Dr Foluke Aderemi, called on students of the faculty and other interested youths to embrace livestock, saying it was a sure way of escaping from unemployment.<br /><br />The Acting Head, Department of Animal Science and Fisheries Management, Dr Tunde Lawal, also urged Nigerian youths to take agriculture seriously, saying it was a lucrative venture but they needed to be dedicated to it.<br /><br /><b>By: Femi Makinde</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The Nigerian Incentive-Based Risk-Sharing System for Agricultural Lending has formally unveiled a technologically-driven model for the agricultural sector aimed at boosting farmers’ revenue by at least N125bn.<br /><br />The initiative to be known as the Farm Aggregation Model for Smallholder Agriculture would be technology driven.<br /><br />It is a rule-based, market-led and technology-driven system of primary production agriculture designed by NIRSAL for smallholder farmers anchored on three principles.<br /><br />The principles are aggregation, structured group dynamic, proportionate cost and profit sharing.<br /><br />These are specifically targeted at achieving economies of scale, so as to drive maximum output and maximum profit.<br /><br />A statement by NIRSAL said the launch was held at the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State.<br /><br />The statement said that the model was designed to simultaneously empower smallholder farmers and boost agricultural production on a structured and sustainable basis.<br /><br />It said, “Based on a projection that between 80 per cent and 90 per cent of a typical per hectare cost of any production is made up of input and services that can be institutionally supplied in a structured business model enabled by NIRSAL Credit Risk Guarantees and other strategic institutional support, FAM-SMART is an attractive investment opportunity for banks and the entire financial services sector.<br /><br />“A conservative estimate of 1,000 geo-cooperatives producing a gross output of 1,250,000 metric tonnes of grain will generate a gross revenue of N125bn. This underscores the immense potential profitability of the FAM-SMART concept.”<br /><br />It quoted the Managing Director of NIRSAL, Mr Aliyu Abdulhameed,&nbsp; to have said that the model was a new paradigm in agricultural primary production in Nigeria.<br /><br /><b>By: Ifeanyi Onuba,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

No committee has even been set up to consider the bill on its merit and this is rather unfortunate.<br /><br />“We are not only dissatisfied with their attitude towards the bill, we are also disappointed with the way they have handled the series of killings in the state. “You never hear them passing any resolution regarding the matter; you never see the Assembly going on oversight functions to see the areas and places that were attacked. They should know that they are representing the people. “So, even if not for anything, because of selfish reasons, they should know that the people who are being killed will reduce their votes during elections and therefore see the need to take action.So, we are sincerely not happy with the performance of the state lawmakers.’’<br /><br /><b>By: James Abraham,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

CPC has recently confirmed by credible information that retailers, mostly in the open market, are using a pesticide to preserve beans\".<br /><br />“The use of 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate (DDVP compound), otherwise marketed and known as sniper to preserve beans, and more particularly to protect them against weevils, is dangerous,” he said.<br /><br />According to Irukera, sniper is potentially injurious when human beings are unduly exposed to it by inhalation, absorption, direct skin contact.<br /><br /><b>Source: NAN</b></span><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Federal government has commenced a confinement field trial on genetically  modified root starch shelf-life elongation for cassava and cowpea varieties at  various institutes in the country.<br />Also, genetically modified cassava root  starch will keep longer than the conventional one after harvest, while rice has  been modified to provide essential ingredients that farmers were struggling with  in the past.<br /> <br />Speaking, Dr. Rose Gidado of the National Biotechnology Development Agency  (NABDA) told The Guardian that International Institute for Tropical Agriculture  (IITA) and Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) handled cassava and  cowpea.She explained that genetic manipulation was devised to complement organic  and conventional farming and streamline production processes, saying that they  are working to bring out genetically modified products.<br /> <br />“Most of the institutes have been undertaking researches using conventional  plant breeding methods, which has proven to be deficient in addressing new  challenges facing farmers in the country,” she said.Explaining further, Gidado  maintained that with optimal use of modern biotechnology, there was a new hope,  adding that industrial farming and food production have propelled a dramatic  shift in global agricultural trends.<br /> <div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M0UVssQmlnM/W5-es15YpHI/AAAAAAAABxk/Qjr34bD-oeUwhQ_pYl8Ns9iqj3JYFi7tACLcBGAs/s1600/Cassava.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"598\" data-original-width=\"1062\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M0UVssQmlnM/W5-es15YpHI/AAAAAAAABxk/Qjr34bD-oeUwhQ_pYl8Ns9iqj3JYFi7tACLcBGAs/s320/Cassava.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />She added that the World Bank had predicted that there will be need to  produce 50 per cent more food by 2050, which means that it has already been  foreseen that world’s population would increase to 10 billion by then.According  to her, modern biotechnology usages would increase agricultural productivity per  acre, as well as ensure drought resistant crops and reduction in the need for  fertilizers and pesticides sprays.<br /> <br />She, however, stressed that these would facilitate adequate food production  globally, while there would be cassava cultivation in rural areas for  consumption and export. “With outstanding yields using modern biotechnology  tools, farmers are motivated to cultivate, while new individuals will find it  rewarding to start agricultural production.<br /> <br />“Globally, various organisations such as United Nations (UN) have created an  enabling environment for scientists to explore opportunities in Nigeria to  ensure that risks associated with new techniques are addressed,” she added.<br /> <strong>By Cornelius Essen,<br />Guardian News</strong><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "ApiExpo 2018: Charting a Way Forward for Beekeeping Business",
    "content": "<br />Bees which are seen by many as a dangerous insect to keep or rear, is also seen by some as a money spinning insect to be nurtured and reared in order accumulate wealth from its various hive products.<br /><br />According to experts, bees can be less dangerous when the beekeeper respects them (bees), it may not sting the beekeepers when the observe the protocols of respecting the insects while ‘stealing’ from them, but otherwise the pains from the insects’ sting is always unbearable.<br /><br />Beekeeping is the rearing and breeding of bees of different types primarily for honey and hive produce. It may also include keeping bees for pollination and environmental management among others.<br /><br />Beekeeping or Apiculture is the maintenance of bee colonies, commonly in man-made hives, most of such bees are honeybees in the the genus Apis.<br /><br />Bees have several raw materials which includes, honey, bee wax, bee venom, royal jelly, propolis, bee bread, pollen. All these raw materials have been proven to be of immense economic value in the international market.<br /><br />This month, Nigeria will be hosting the ApiExpo Africa 2018, which will see the convergence of investors in the Apicultural sub-sector across the world, coming to Nigeria to discuss the way forward in beekeeping, also using the opportunity to interface with Nigerian beekeepers to see possible areas of collaboration.<br /><br />ApiExpo is a continental trade Expo&nbsp; organised by ApiTrade Africa, a pan-African not-for profit organisation headquartered in Uganda but which works in all the 55 African Union Member States.<br /><br />The event is held biennially in different African countries bringing together every allied industry around the global beekeeping sector.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AgfEBsdeS0w/W5fPTQxmGmI/AAAAAAAABv4/z0EKED7TxNk-ilo-idVty5LoFOKUcW65ACLcBGAs/s1600/bees.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-AgfEBsdeS0w/W5fPTQxmGmI/AAAAAAAABv4/z0EKED7TxNk-ilo-idVty5LoFOKUcW65ACLcBGAs/s1600/bees.jpg\" /></a></div><br />ApiExpo is the African version of APIMONDIA (World Beekeeping Congress), it covers Exhibitions, Scientific sessions and Business meetings for investors and other actors along the value chain (beekeepers, packers, processors, Input fabricators, Researchers, academia etc). It is a congregation of every stakeholder along the beekeeping value chain<br /><br />The ApiExpo is targeted towards setting up of a veritable platform for the convergence of apicultural leaders, international experts, farmers and processors from all over the world for the promotion of the practice and benefits of bee farming/processing in Africa.<br /><br />It will also create international trade opportunities and foreign market access for the Beekeeping industry, attract national and international investments into the Beekeeping industry, and link and sustain these trade and investment benefits into long term industry processes.<br /><br />The Expo will stimulate refined processes for sustainable growth through seamless collaboration between public and private sector players, strengthen the private sector towards sustained development, create youth employment thereby reducing rural urban drift &amp; rural poverty.<br /><br />The ApiExpo is also expected to increase food security through reduction of hunger related malnutrition in order to meet the 2030 zero hunger UN and FAO target and maintain eco-diversity balance through mitigation of global warming.<br /><br />Apiculture&nbsp; contributes tremendous amount in Value to the economy of any nation that harnesses the potentials in the sector. The honey bees work in different capacities to store resources, defend their residence, nurse their brood.<br /><br />World Beekeeping Trade is valued at $450 billion (N162 trillion), Pollination output is valued at $250 billion (N90 trillion), the Net Value is at $11.5 Billion (N4.14 trillion, World Honey Production is at 1.8 million tons, African Market Share is 5 per cent (90,000 tons), Ethiopia’s Market Share accounts for 40,000 tons valued at $255,300,000 (N91.9 billion), while Nigeria market accounts for 15,000 tons valued at $96,025,000 (N34.6 billion).<br /><br />With about N210 or N410, (depending on the type of hives), one can start up a beekeeping business and make almost double if the investment from honey production and collection of other hive materials.<br /><br />To start a beekeeping business with the Topbar hive, you are required to acquire 10 hives (N150,000), 2 bee suits (N20,000), 2 pair of gloves (N6,000), 2 pairs of shoes (N10,000), 1 hive tool (N1,000), 1 smoker (N5,000), maintenance (N18,000), totaling N210,000.<br /><br />During harvest, this method is expected to yield 150kg of honey, and 37kg of bee wax, which values at at N524,000 in the market.<br /><br />For the Langstroth be hive, the beekeeper is expected to buy 10 hives valued at N350,000, 2 bee suits (N20,000), 2 pair of gloves (N6,000), 2 pairs of shoes (N10,000), 1 hive tool (N1,000), 1 smoker (N5,000), maintenance (N18,000), totaling N210,000.<br /><br />At harvest, the Langstroth hive is expected to produce 300kg of honey, and 15kg of bee wax, all valued at N930,000 in the market, which is double of the investment.<br /><br />The importance of bee to agriculture cannot be over emphasized, it is said that if bees ceases to exist today, in the next 4 years, human beings will cease to exist, because bees help in pollinating majority of the flowering crops in the world.<br /><br />According to an expert in beekeeping, Oluwaseun Johnson, “two thirds of the world’s 3000 species of agricultural crops require agents for pollination.<br /><br />“Between $235 billion and $577 billion worth of annual global food production relies on direct contributions by pollinators. Pollinators such as bees, birds and bats affect 35 percent of the world’s crop production, increasing outputs of 87 of the leading food crops worldwide, as well as many plant-derived medicines.<br /><br />The exact economic value of bee pollinated crops globally is not known but we know that bees exclusively pollinate Almonds, 90% of blueberries, apples avocados, cucumbers, oranges and pumpkins”.<br /><br />Also according Oluwaseun Johnson, “in the United States alone, the nation’s largest producer of apples is Washington State. In a typical year, about three out of five (10 to 12 billion) apples in the United States come from Washington, and without bees, the cross-pollination needed to produce apples just wouldn’t happen on a scale large enough.<br /><br />“About 80 percent of the world’s almond supply comes from California, which requires about half of the honeybee population in the United States for pollination each year. Valued at more than $3 billion, the almond crop is completely dependent on honeybees for pollination.<br /><br />“Without honeybees, though, the majority of the country’s $193 million cucumber crop would be nonexistent. According to the National Resources Defense Council (NRDC), more than $15 billion worth of crops are pollinated by bees each year just in the United States alone.<br /><br />The Chairperson of the Organizing Committee of the ApiE, Dr Dooshima Kwange in while speaking at a program for media engagement with ApiExpo Africa Organization Committee, said that beyond the Expo, the target is to increase the awareness of honey production and make it a business that will be used to lift people out of poverty.<br /><br />“We want to see that livelihood are increased, we want to see that allied industries, the pharmaceutical, the cosmetic industries have raw materials, we want to see that the processors have enough to process, we also want to see that we cut down on importing, we also want to see that we start exporting , so those are areas that we are looking at beyond the hives”, Dr Kwange noted.<br /><br />In this year’s ApiExpo, the benefits to Nigeria in general and the Apiculture industry specifically will be improvement in livelihoods, job creation and empowerment for the populace.<br /><br />Nigeria will also benefit the diversification of economy and generation of more foreign exchange, improvement in the quality and quantity of production of honey and other hive products. This will ensure food safety and increased raw materials for requisite industries.<br /><br />Improvement in the sector would help in actualizing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) – 1, 2, 3, 5, 12 and 15.<br /><br />Other benefits include exposure of all participants along the beekeeping value chain to modern technologies showcased during the expo,this will help in promotion of value additions in hive products.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Interested investors and land owners are free to register on our platform. There is also a room for partnership. Aside the fact that we are connecting with communities on the enlightenment on the values of agriculture; we are also engaging youths on how to become successful through agriculture.<br /><br />“We have outlined a suitable platform on how to empower youths through this initiative, any interested member would join the platform as an intern and would be on IT for two-six month, depending on the crop farming they are interested in. Later he would be upgraded to the stage of an upcoming commercial farmer under the commercial farmer guidance. It is a practical farming and our goal is to teach people what professional farming entails. We will allocate land to the person if the person has no land and provide necessary infrastructure. Technical guidance would also be provided and the produced goods would be processed by the commercial farmers.<br /><br />Having gone through all these training, the youth farmer would have become an excerpt in the field.<br /><br />“We have a wide vision for empower youths in Nigeria and Africa with this initiative in order to continue to generate new young commercial farmers, as well as correct the common insinuation that farming is old men business, but a gainful employment that they can exploit. And we have also created a secured platform for interested investors, such as constant monitoring irrespective of your location, the instant return of capital.

This is what we need for now as way to revamp the economy of the country through agriculture. This can be achievable because we have land and other necessary resources,” he added.<br /><br />A representative of International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan, Mr Adepitan Adedayo, acknowledged the brains behind EZ Farming, just as he noted that he was ready to collaborate with them in bringing agricultural technology close to the farmers, especially the youths.<br /><br />Another beneficiary, Oluwatosin Oni, a graduate of Political Science from the Obafemi Awolowo University, said: “This is a golden opportunity the employed and unemployed youths needs to tap into. I am delighted to be a beneficiary of this initiative; I am encouraged with what I have seen so far and I am ready to start work with them and I believe that in no time I would also become a successful farmer. I am confident that the era of searching for jobs is over; it has been three year now, I thank God that I came across this initiative.”<br /><br />An investor of EZ Farming, Mrs Timileyin Oyebode stated that initiative was a welcome development, especially geared towards youth empowerment and also ensuring that agriculture is serving its purpose for sustainability and growth of the country and other African nation.<br /><br /><b>By: Seyi Sokoya</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />FARMERS‘ FUNDS To UNQUALIFIED AND DISHONEST MIDDLEMEN<br /><br />It has come to our notice that some persons and groups who claim to be stakeholders or participants in various agricultural projects are currently orchestrating a vicious and well-funded campaign of disinformation and blackmail against NIRSAL.<br /><br />In an effort to invest their bogus claims with invented credibility. these elements have been making the rounds of media houses with false claims that NIRSAL. itself a CBN-owned entity. is holding up funds released by the CBN under the Anchor Borrowers Programme lABPl.<br /><br />Some of them have even gone as far as organizing anti-NIRSAL protests and press conferences citing documents that were still undergoing processing and funds yet to be released by the CBN. Others have also been busy whipping up sentiments against NIRSAL amongst farmers. who they claim to represent.<br /><br />Our investigations reveal that among these elements are so-called “leaders\" of farmers' groups who did not meet the relevant criteria for participation in the ASP through the NIRSAL PFI window. by filing up registers of ”cooperatives” they formed with fake names and unidentifiable persons. In this category also. are so-called “farmers\" who do not have farmlands.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LyXMQ-7WW4Y/WrNs3mSGhkI/AAAAAAAABRo/UQ-LaWh5B_kzkJrVhE-8U-jWctl04lR2wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/nirsal-300x108.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"108\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LyXMQ-7WW4Y/WrNs3mSGhkI/AAAAAAAABRo/UQ-LaWh5B_kzkJrVhE-8U-jWctl04lR2wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/nirsal-300x108.jpg\" /></a></div><br />It is interesting to note that the farmers who failed credit checks are the ones being used to mount these negative campaigns and protests. It is this latter category of “farmers\" that are conniving with these so-called “aggregators” to confuse genuine farmers on the procedures and processes of accessing the CBN ABP facility.<br /><br />We also have information that some “aggregators” have fraudulently collected monies from farmers promising to deliver loan facilities through the CBN ABP and other NIRSAL funding windows. The objective of the campaign which is being waged on several media platforms is clear: to intimidate the corporation into releasing funds to unqualified and unverified entities under the NIRSAL window of the Central Bank of Nigeria's Anchor Borrowers Programme (ASP).<br /><br />But this will certainly not happen because NIRSAL takes its mandate from Central Bank of Nigeria too seriously to fall for these underhand and unethical tactics. As an agricultural finance risk management institution. NIRSAL has no intention of compromising its internal processes or the ASP guidelines by falling for these shenanigans.<br /><br />NIRSAL has a mandate from the Central Bank of Nigeria to deploy its risk management mechanisms. its nationwide footprint. its partnership with Channel Partner Banks and its technical capacities to directly empower farmers by de-risking agriculture and facilitating agribusiness. with the ultimate objective of boosting agricultural productivity and food security in the country. In pursuit of this objective. NIRSAL has disbursed and continues to disburse ABP funds to tens of thousands of genuine and verified farmers across the 36 states of the federation and the FCT under the ASP. To make it easier for legitimate farmers to access approved funds. NIRSAL will continue to make direct disbursement to qualified farmers accounts. who have fulfilled all necessary conditions precedent to such support.<br /><br />The notion that NIRSAL. under undue pressure. will release monies meant for innocent smallholder farmers - most of whom are of low-income status in rural areas- to conscienceless middlemen. blackmailers and propagandists is antithetical to everything NIRSAL stands for and synonymous with CORRUPTION.<br /><br />We are by this notice alerting genuine farmers and farmer associations not to allow these dishonest elements who have become ubiquitous. to continue their nefarious activities to deprive you or your associations of legitimate credit support from the CBN and Federal Government under the Anchor Borrowers' Programme.<br /><br />We are also alerting the media and public to the existence of these nefarious persons and groups through this disclaimer and urge anyone who is in doubt to reach NIRSAL on Mom or call +231. 813 988 2220 - 23 for information or clarification.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Signed:</b><br /><b>Anne IHUGBA</b><br /><b>Head.

    "content": "<br />The federal government has disbursed N150 billion to local farmers under the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN)’s Anchor Borrowers Programme (ABP) in two years to assist farmers of key agricultural commodities.<br /><br />This is coming as the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, Wednesday said the ministry would ensure that farmers repay loans granted them through the apex bank’s Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF), warning that there would be no excuses for default.<br /><br />Speaking Wednesday in Lagos, the Executive Director, Bank of Agriculture, Mr. Niyi Akenzua, said plans were underway to disburse more funds before the end of the year.<br /><br />He said the Bank of Agriculture was working in collaboration with the CBN to boost rice production in Nigeria, adding that the efforts made in local production of rice has saved Nigeria about $800 million in foreign exchange.<br />He said Nigeria would cease to import rice by the end of 2019 because it would be able to meet local demand of rice before the end of the next year.<br /><br />Akenzua said the N150 billion was part of the N250 billion intervention fund given to the Bank of Agriculture by the federal government in 2016 to boost food production in the country.<br /><br />“When this government took over, the price of crude was very low. That forced the administration to look to agriculture to revive the economy. That was how the Bank of Agriculture was revived. In 2016, government gave the bank N250 billion intervention fund. In 2017, we disbursed N100 billion for anchor borrowers to boost rice production. This year, we have already disbursed N50 billion. We are working in collaboration with CBN and our target is that by end of next year, Nigeria will stop importation of rice. With the progress we have made in local rice production so far, we have saved government almost $800 million in foreign exchange,” Akenzua said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T574D_mIyhQ/WhvstnpCjPI/AAAAAAAAA2U/CBIVBwRQ92kU55wFFGubfCeynhzc_HjwQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Ogbeh.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"462\" data-original-width=\"696\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T574D_mIyhQ/WhvstnpCjPI/AAAAAAAAA2U/CBIVBwRQ92kU55wFFGubfCeynhzc_HjwQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Ogbeh.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Speaking at an event organised by Crenov 8 to sensitise farmers and the public on the planned meet-the-farmers conference slated for October in Lagos, Akenzua said the Bank of Agriculture is ready to disburse loans to farmers to boost rice production and other farm produce.<br /><br />Akenzua commended Crenov8 Consulting, a leading consulting and digital technology firm, which is connecting African farmers to Middle East where farm produce from Africa is in high demand.<br /><br />The consulting firm said at the pre-conference media launch that it would hold agro export gathering tagged ‘Meet-the-Farmers Conference (MTFC)’ on October 10, 2018 in Lagos.<br /><br />“Meet The Farmers’ conference is an agro stakeholders’ conference that aims to connect large scale agro-commodity producers to buyers from the Middle East. Key Stakeholders from Africa and GCC (Middle East) will come together during the one-day event to network, collaborate, and form potential business partnerships across borders to ensure food security in the Middle East and promote agribusiness in Africa.<br /><br />Crenov8 embarked on this mission in 2017 to create a platform where the African agricultural producers will meet with the off takers in the Middle East and beyond.<br /><br />According to Crenov 8’s spokesman, Bola Oyedele, the main purpose of this event is to establish and strengthen the international trade ties that exist between Africa and the GCC through agriculture, utilising the unique<br />positioning of Dubai as a hub.<br /><br />No Excuse for Loan Default<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ogbeh has assured Nigerians that his ministry will join hands to ensure that farmers repay loans granted them through the CBN’s Real Sector Support Facility (RSSF), warning that there will be no excuses for default.<br /><br />He said given that refinancing of existing loans are forbidden under the programme, borrowers, particularly farmers and industrialists are advised to strictly adhere to the terms and conditions of the loans and utilise funds for the purpose for which it was granted.<br /><br />Addressing journalists at a press briefing, the minister said borrowers would have “to swear to God and yourself that you will repay. We don’t want the banks losing all their money on grounds of charity”.<br /><br />He noted that the terms of the loans are healthy at seven-year tenure, two-year moratorium and a maximum of N10 billion per borrower.<br /><br />He, however, expressed concern about the common farmers who form the bulk of the population as they may be unable to meet conditions for accessing the CBN intervention.<br /><br />According to him, “We are going to work out a system where cooperatives become the borrowers on behalf of their members since they don’t have relevant collateral to provide the banks.<br /><br />“We want to sit with the CBN and tell the banks that a certain portion of your loans must be reserved for people who are borrowing N300,000 to N2 million, especially young people who want to add value.”<br /><br />He added: “We will work out a formula where no one is left out because if the big guys take it and banks will rather deal with the big guys to save them the problem of pursuing borrowers all over the villages- the cooperative will do the job.<br /><br />“We will also talk with microfinance banks to see if they can charge nine per cent.”<br /><br />Ogbeh also said the ministry is currently working with the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) to see how lending to agriculture could further be reduced to between five and six per cent.<br /><br />According to him, borrowers are mandated to make the project and records available for inspection and verification by the apex bank.<br /><br />While expressing immense gratitude to President Muhammadu Buhari, the CBN and the Bankers’ Committee for the new policy of single digit – nine per cent lending to the agriculture and manufacturing sectors, the minister said the new regime represented a major step towards reversing the horrible damage done to Africa by the Structural Adjustment Programme (SAP) of the mid-eighties.<br /><br />He said the outrageous interest charges by commercial banks over the last three decades had largely been responsible for the slow growth of the economy.<br /><br />He said: “We also urge borrowers especially farmers and industrialists to ensure, they repay whatever they borrow because banks are not charitable organisations, especially as we intend to use the co-operatives to move agricultural credit to the most vulnerable segment of our population namely the women and the youths.”<br /><br />He added that with the new interest rate regime, which was facilitated by his ministry, there is no further excuse why farmers should lag behind.<br /><br />Ogbeh reiterated the CBN’s warning that the facility is not for lending to traders, stressing that an individual who may want to borrow under the guise of agriculture or manufacturing will be denied credit.<br /><br />He said: “We need to grow this economy, we need to feed this country; the population is growing at frightening rate and we can’t afford a situation where someday, Nigeria falls short of food and we begin to experience the kinds of problems which another country — Venezuela — is facing.”<br /><br />He said the ministry would continue to pursue the growth of agriculture particularly exports as “the oil and gas era may not be with us for too long.”<br /><br /><b>By: James Emejo in Abuja and Chinedu Eze in Lagos</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

It said that the model known as, Secured Agricultural Commodity Route, SACR, was currently undergoing a comprehensive and rigorous process of internal testing before its formal deployment.<br /><br />The initial route would cut across the eleven states in the Lakaji corridor including Katsina, Jigawa, Kano, Kaduna, Niger, Kwara, Oyo, Osun, Ogun, Lagos and is expected to take three months to implement starting from August 2018. NIRSAL explained that the SACR has been built around four complementary components, namely: Agro Runner; Secured Commodity Aggregation Zones; Specialised Haulage System; and Dedicated Commodity Route.<br /><br />The agro runner would enable farmers to call and book for their produce to be picked up at the farm-gate and transported either to the designated aggregated zones or commodity markets. Secured Commodity Aggregation Zones have been designated for specified produce aggregation.<br /><br />There will be tax and regulatory checks on haulage vehicles that will operate in these zones. The Specialised Haulage Services would work with Logistic companies whose specialized vehicles are tailored to transport agricultural commodities around the country.<br /><br />The haulage services would include the crating system that reduce wastage of fresh fruits and vegetables, live fish haulage tanks, etc. Under the Dedicated Commodity Route, the route would be designated for commodity haulage and all security agents would be informed of the movement of the specialized trucks so as to facilitate movement and timely delivery.<br /><br />The agency said that to make it successful, the model would rely both on the functionality and adoption rate of these components, as well as, the synergy between the relevant stakeholders to ensure commodities move efficiently from production areas to commodity/consumer markets. Partnership of critical actors and target beneficiaries such as Transport Unions (i.e. NURTW, NARTO), Agro Dealers, Produce Aggregators, Retailers, Smallholder Farmers, Logistic service providers, State and Local Governments, it said remained critical.<br /><br /><b>By Emma Ujah,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

The quality of the meat and the economic indexes of the fattening of livestock depend on the species, breed, sex, age, health, and fatness of the animal, as well as on type and intensiveness of feeding and on maintenance conditions. Animals that are fattened include the entire healthy population to be slaughtered for meat.<br /><br />&nbsp;Ruminant animals’ productivity in Nigeria is low. Livestock slaughtered are generally old and produce over a period with a variable nutritional history, yielding tougher meat than desirable. Currently, nutrition is so poor that feed finishers only invest in mature animals.<br /><br />&nbsp;Much of the local feed finishing enterprise activity is of poor quality and only remains viable because of the high price of meat. Professional butchers in towns such as Kano and other cities, are unwilling to buy village livestock because of the poor meat quality, and source grass-fed animals from more remote areas. Red meat sector stakeholders ranked the lack of quality feed finished animals as the greatest of 15 constraints to industry competitiveness.<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wj35Jzw57-I/Wh_hlfqBRFI/AAAAAAAAA5A/BRDRNa-y48MkgPpf1h81B6amO-jxGqGNwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Layers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wj35Jzw57-I/Wh_hlfqBRFI/AAAAAAAAA5A/BRDRNa-y48MkgPpf1h81B6amO-jxGqGNwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Layers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>The introduction of the Growth and Employment in States 1 (GEMS 1) programme, a five-year programme jointly funded by the World Bank and DFID is based in Kano, with its aim, which is to increase growth and employment, especially for poor men and women, by improving competitiveness in strategically important Nigerian industry clusters in selected states and nationally, as well as through business environment reform.<br /><br />Wholly funded by DFID, the target market for the GEMS1 component is the meat and leather industry. It addresses major government and market failures in the system, thus bringing about systemic change; improving the incomes of the poor, especially women and the young.<br /><br />GEMS 1 has come up with an intensive feed finishing (FF) technique that covers several components including the use of least cost ruminant feed supplement, roughages, water and veterinary services together with appropriate housing and tethering.<br /><br />&nbsp;The new technique is aimed at radicating subsistence culture of animal fattening or production to commercially viable venture. This is achieved by reducing time of fattening, crushing crop waste into ruminant feed thereby increasing feed availability and increasing feed intake by the animal, which enhances growth and increases the number of cycle per year to fattening animal.<br /><br />The modern feed finishing techniques enables the farmer to feed-finish small ruminants to maturity within 40 – 50 days, while for large ruminants, within 80 – 90 days.<br /><br />Opportunities In Fattening Business As A livestock Fattener Dealer: You can make good return on investment as a dealer of livestock fattener because of the demand in the market as a result of the need for farmers to make profit from rearing livestock and have healthy, fattened animals for slaughter and skins for local and international market.<br /><br />Livestock Fattening: The introduction of fattener livestock rearing has become interesting and attractive, not just for the old people and northern farmers only but for the growing youths who now see Agric as a business.<br /><br />With the modern feed finishing techniques, which enable a farmer to feed-finish small ruminants to maturity within 40 – 50 days, with that of large ruminants within 80 – 90 days, the farming business has become more lucrative than the old system that is discouraging.<br /><br />Meat Packaging: This is a business that is taking a good shape as a result of the demand for fresh healthy meat, the growing population of the middle class and springing up of shopping malls all over the cities.<br /><br />Nealing On Livestock: You can make your money as an agribusiness entrepreneur dealing on fattened livestock that are fresh and healthy.<br /><br />The demands are high, you don’t need to own a farm, all you need to do is to create the market and the farmers are there. Finally with the improvement on the livestock value chain and support of GSM 1and 11, this is an Agribusiness to venture into with sure return on investment with over 100 per cent.<br /><br /><b>Source: Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Creating decent employment opportunities for youth in Africa’s agriculture sector can significantly reduce youth migration from the continent, Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) Director-General José Graziano da Silva, has said.<br /><br />According to him, the FAO firmly believes that if youths are provided these opportunities, they will not leave the continent to look for opportunities elsewhere.<br /><br />The latest Africa Agriculture Status Report (AASR), had indicated that agriculture will be Africa’s quiet revolution.According to the report commissioned by Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), smart investments in the food system can aid the revolution if planned correctly.<br /><br />Despite 37 percent of the population now living in urban centres, the report showed that most jobs have been created in lower paid, less productive services rather than in industry, with this service sector accounting for more than half of the continent’s GDP.“We have the means to provide those opportunities right here where you can see and participate in the future of your countries and the continent”, Graziano da Silva said.<br /><br /><br />FAO requested for the establishment of a youth facility, which would assist young people in addressing some of the challenges they face when setting up and expanding agricultural businesses. The facility would be piloted in Rwanda and later rolled out to the rest of Africa.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--VJl5HznAUA/W3_l-TjOrnI/AAAAAAAABtA/QR42RjZvvOsbFC56gRNdiypvaZn8-Op0wCLcBGAs/s1600/Jose-Graziano-da-Silva-1062x598.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"598\" data-original-width=\"1062\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--VJl5HznAUA/W3_l-TjOrnI/AAAAAAAABtA/QR42RjZvvOsbFC56gRNdiypvaZn8-Op0wCLcBGAs/s320/Jose-Graziano-da-Silva-1062x598.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Approximately 65 to 75 percent of the people migrating from Africa are youth, many in search of employment opportunities. Tens of millions of jobs will have to be created each year in the Africa as the continent’s population continues to grow steadily. The agricultural sector including the related food systems and value chains can offer substantial entrepreneurial opportunities for the youth.<br /><br />In his remarks at this week’s international youth conference held in Rwanda, the FAO Director-General stressed the need to continue working closely with a wide range of actors to support the youth.<br /><br />“We have started with the first step and I hope that we will be together throughout the journey. When you are in a hurry, you go alone, but if you want to go further, you need to go together. We want to go further and we want to go with you,” Graziano da Silva said.<br /><br />Among several challenges, conference participants highlighted factors of production such as land as one of the most significant barriers for young people wanting to start or expand agricultural enterprises. This was further compounded by limited access to credit facilities for young people across the continent.<br /><br />Through an 8-point communiqué, the youth outlined their recommended actions for immediate focus; youth-led policy action, institutionalizing the youth conference (biennial), capacity development, reinforcing enabling and institutional environments, equipping rural areas with critical services essential for modern agriculture, agribusiness and value chain support, changing negative image of agriculture and supporting national youth platforms to share knowledge and best practices.<br /><br />Urging the youth to reverse the often-negative perceptions associated with agriculture and take pride in being farmers requires the need to change the image and conversation around agriculture and shift the focus to the opportunities and profits to be made across the agri-food chain.<br /><b><br /></b><b>By Femi Adekoya</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations said it planned to install 100 Farmer Field School communities in 2018 in the North-East to boost agricultural production.<br /><br />The UN agency also said it urgently needed about $18m to meet the needs of agro-based households in the crisis-ridden northeast.<br /><br />In a statement on Thursday, the FAO revealed that it had so far trained 51 agricultural experts in the FFS approach in the North-East.<br /><br />The FAO said, “In July and August 2018, an additional 26 experts across the three North-East states of Adamawa, Borno and Yobe were trained in the FAO’s landmark programme for boosting pro-poor and participatory agricultural extension support worldwide.”<br /><br />It added, “Following the training of an initial batch of 25 agricultural officers from government agricultural agencies and non-governmental organisations and the establishment of Farmer Field School community groups, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations graduated its second batch of the FFS facilitators on 18th August, 2018 in Maiduguri, Borno.<br /><br />“The three-week long intensive workshop equipped experts supporting conflict-affected farmers in the North-East with the skills to set up and run at least two farmer field schools per facilitator.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1NiLmT15bs/WdcytliKB8I/AAAAAAAAAQU/vdbnWHNVQy4gRJyJSo1I2O6uvDiluRGXwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Food%2Band%2BAgriculture%2BOrganisation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"113\" data-original-width=\"113\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1NiLmT15bs/WdcytliKB8I/AAAAAAAAAQU/vdbnWHNVQy4gRJyJSo1I2O6uvDiluRGXwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Food%2Band%2BAgriculture%2BOrganisation.jpg\" /></a></div><br />It also said, “The FFS is an interactive and participatory ‘learning by doing’ approach involving groups of 20-25 farmers, pastoralists or fisher folk and a trained facilitator. Group members experiment with best practices while discussing challenges and solutions to agriculture-related issues in their own local context. The FFS is usually comprised of resource-poor participants who typically face limited access to education, information, extension (for example, farming and pastoral advice) services, market access and financial capital.”<br /><br />The release quoted the FAO representative in Nigeria, Suffyan Koroma, as saying that the FFS is another entry point for the FAO to support the most at-risk farming households in the region, and that the “UN agency plans to install, with regional partners, at least 100 of these schools in 2018.”<br /><br />Koroma said, “Smallholder farmers face huge hurdles in managing increasingly complex agro-ecosystems. Through FFS, farmers will learn how to create sustainable solutions to farming and pastoral issues.”<br /><br />He also said, “The FAO’s work in the North-East goes far beyond the provision of livelihood-saving agro-inputs like seed and fertilizer, and that “the FAO works closely with farmers to ensure that inputs they receive are being properly utilised; that they are employing the most effective techniques in the management of their crops and animals. And that generally, farming households have the best conditions to boost their resilience.”<br /><br />The release recalled that the “FAO’s ongoing rainy season programme delivered seed and fertiliser to about 100,000 households as of July. Crop and livestock production is expected to rise with the increased access to farmland in newly accessible areas in the region.<br /><br />“However, access to land remains a key issue as numerous communities are restricted to only small parcels of land for production and cannot use traditional growing and grazing areas due to lingering security risks. In the North-East Nigeria, farmers often rely on sharecropping (planting on land belonging to others in exchange for a portion of harvests) or rent less than one hectare of land for subsistence agriculture.”<br /><br />It stated that the June 2018 Displacement Tracking Matrix revealed that about 1,549,630 people had been returned to their original communities in the region and that returnees, host communities and internally displaced people required urgent support to resume their livelihoods; 80 per cent of which was estimated to be agriculture-based.<br /><br /><b>By: Kayode Idowu,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Cross River state has said its new rice seedling facility will fetch it about N13billion annually.<br /><br />Briefing newsmen in Calabar on Tuesday during a facility tour of the factory, the State Commissioner for Finance, Prof. Anthony Eneji, said the factory built at a cost of over N3 billion in terms of planning, design, construction and equipping it, the machines, the access and the outdoor situation, all the facilities together, “it is expected to meet the hybrid seed demands of the entire South South and South East zone”.<br /><br />He said the factory is estimating to start with 1000 hectares of land and if we get 8 tonnes per hectare from each of this hectare, you multiply that by 1000 hectares, each harvest within three weeks or a month will yield a return of N1.2 billion.<br /><br />Prof. Eneji said, “if you are selling one tonne of hybrid rice at N150, 000, then you can use your calculator and do the arithmetic, you will know we are talking in billions of naira”. This was put at about N13 billion per year.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kT8kVBkjvCY/W35zZaaw8HI/AAAAAAAABso/CmwHalq53gca1AkRH8XqiaZfAcc8y2UKwCLcBGAs/s1600/Rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"598\" data-original-width=\"1062\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-kT8kVBkjvCY/W35zZaaw8HI/AAAAAAAABso/CmwHalq53gca1AkRH8XqiaZfAcc8y2UKwCLcBGAs/s320/Rice.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said, “this is a totally self-sustaining project if we manage it the way we are going. It can pay back whatever we are putting into this investment in three to four years. For management reasons the state has created a special SUV called Cross River Rice Company and charged it with management responsibility. It is under the Ministry of Agriculture. It is a state project”.<br /><br />For now he said, “we can handle up to 200 or 300 hectares in this facility. The seedlings are raised on demand basis. You know they have to be taken off within three weeks.<br /><br />“Our local rice, we are growing two tonnes per hectare at best but with our hybrid seeds, we are aiming at minimum of 8.5 to 9 tonnes per hectare. Actually as we are making contacts we are going o bring some gem plasms there that would help us advance even up to 13 tonnes per hectare and so we would get the parent seeds from those centres of excellence and be able to develop our local rice in our laboratory here in the rice centre.”<br /><br />On employment, the commissioner said, “We would conservatively put the number of direct employment at 10, 000. But the indirect and other multiplier effects those who would be farming rice at the various local government and the layouts they are going to hire and everything, then the processors and so on, it is quite enormous”.<br /><br /><b>By Anietie Akpan,</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

We also leaders in cassava but we are not doing well enough in cassava processing and value addition and we are number 4 in cashew nuts out of which we earned 700 million dollars this year”<br /><br />He said the biggest applause in the agricultural revolution in the country is Nigerians themselves who heeded President Muhammadu Buhari’s call to return to the farms particularly women and youth.<br /><br />ALSO READ: Bauchi gov launches 2018 farming season, pegs fertilizer to N5,500 per bag<br /><br />“the biggest news probably is what Nigerians have done for which we remain eternally grateful , the response of Nigerians to the call by the President to return to agriculture is unparallel particularly among young people, the youths are everywhere getting involved in agriculture youth who before now had no interest in Agriculture because it was a drudgery and wasn’t attractive”<br /><br />He added that a time will come in this country when Politicians will not find people coming to their houses to beg for handouts but the politicians will have to go the farms to beg farmers and convince them to leave their farms and to attend political rallies.<br /><br />“a time is coming in the very near future when politicians will not find people rushing to their homes to collect handout but will have to go to farms and villages to beg voters then democracy will become quite serious because you will have to be able to convince them that you have something you have done for them before or you going to do for them to persuade them to attend your rallies”<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Element that will Boost Agriculture in Nigeria",
    "content": "<br />Many years ago, a former President and one of the founding fathers of the United States, Thomas Jefferson, said, “Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals and happiness.”<br /><br />Nigeria possesses a large expanse of land estimated at 91 million; of this, 81 million hectares are arable, characterised by rich soil, warm all-year-round temperatures and well-distributed rainfall. An estimated 18 million hectares of this land is classified as permanent pasture for livestock production.<br /><br />Nigeria is an agricultural nation; the green on the national flag signifies that. Over the years, Nigeria’s dependence on crude oil has led to a massive decline in agriculture, and the negative impact of this decline has been evident in food production, food importation, and an overall economic food crises. Growing the agricultural sector in Nigeria will require a collective effort between the public and the private sectors of the nation.<br /><br />Agriculture as a business – agribusiness – focuses on the profitability in cultivating crops and rearing livestock or in many cases, as seen in the northern parts of the country, a mixed farming culture. There is an increased need to focus on livestock farming — away from the usual rearing of cattle, poultry and fishery. In this case, there is need to focus on pigs, through an exceptional initiative called PorkMoney.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lGcLsYoTv3k/Wlx8IeOhqZI/AAAAAAAAA_o/uh5SHuuFqGQUbFIbUwhpfWrTpVkhSviUQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AGRIC-300x277.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"277\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lGcLsYoTv3k/Wlx8IeOhqZI/AAAAAAAAA_o/uh5SHuuFqGQUbFIbUwhpfWrTpVkhSviUQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AGRIC-300x277.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Why pork? Pork is the most widely eaten meat in the world, accounting for over 40 per cent of the world’s meat consumption. It is high in protein, essential vitamins, minerals, amino acid and is good for overall health. Some pork parts, like that of tenderloin, loin chops and sirloin roast, made from the lean cuts, are more healthy than chicken. The PorkMoney business initiative considers the health benefits of pork and the financial benefits related to its sales as a lucrative source that will in the long term contribute immensely to the growth of agriculture in Nigeria; creating jobs in the process.<br /><br />Already, some Nigerians who are promoting the PorkMoney venture in the country have created an agribusiness subscription plan where partners can yield profits with an initial deposit of N250,000. PorkMoney, with its partners, led by Ghanaian actor and businessman, John Dumelo, and Oke-Aro pig farm, said to be Africa’s largest pig farm, have proposed a collaborative plan to grow the agricultural sector through pig farming in Nigeria and Ghana, where PorkMoney will run its operations and eventually replicate same in other parts of Africa. The PorkMoney initiative will be launched on June 4, 2018.<br /><br /><b>By: Ozioma Ubabukoh</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Farmers lament Rampaging Army worm Invasion",
    "content": "<br />Fall ArmyWorm (FAW) is regarded as one of the most destructive insect pests that attack crops each planting season especially maize.&nbsp; The pest has been reported in 46 of Africa’s 54 countries.<br /><br />In 2015, the pest was confirmed to have spread to some agrarian states in Nigeria, where it ravaged farmlands and destroyed crops mostly maize farms in that year. Farmers lost billions of naira as they struggled to contain the pest.<br /><br />Ironically between 2016 and 2017, the pest&nbsp; had spread across no fewer than 26 states in the country, ravaging maize farms in the affected states and posing huge threat to food security especially among smallholder farmers.<br />Since appearing on the African continent it has already caused more than $13 billion in crop losses and could continue to cost $6 billion loss a year if not properly contained.<br /><br />Experts have warned Nigerian farmers to be at alert in their farms, as early tackling of armyworm will save them from losing between N360 to N400 billion in the 2018 planting season.<br /><br />They opined the potential impact of the Fall armyworm as a major food security and economic risk for African nations cannot be overstated, particularly those in sub-saharan Africa. Therefore, governments and stakeholders must look for ways of containing the pest mostly among the smallholder farmers.<br /><br />Already, governments of various countries around the world have been spending millions of dollars to find lasting solutions to the armyworm syndrome in order to avoid food insecurity and economy risk.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3DwPHsQLCcg/Wwu-pba5zTI/AAAAAAAABoo/MMKUC-HfhlEYn6m-tvyNEW9CsrGI1Sf3ACLcBGAs/s1600/Worm%2Binvasion.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"166\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3DwPHsQLCcg/Wwu-pba5zTI/AAAAAAAABoo/MMKUC-HfhlEYn6m-tvyNEW9CsrGI1Sf3ACLcBGAs/s1600/Worm%2Binvasion.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Daily Sun learnt that Brazil alone spends a staggering $600 million controlling armyworm. Armyworm is a very deleterious pest, capable of destroying entire crops in a matter of weeks. The larvae feed on all types of grasses, early stages of cereal crops (e.g., corn, rice, wheat, millet, sorghum) sugar cane, and occasionally on coconut.<br /><br />Experts also revealed that If proper control measures are not implemented, the Fall armyworm could cause extensive maize yield losses of up to $6.2 billion per year in just 12 countries in Africa, which poses a significant threat to the food security, income and livelihoods of over 350 million African smallholder farm families that consume maize as a staple crop.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, an Agric Business Coach, AfricanFarmer Mogaji, said that most Nigerian farmers are facing the war of armyworm because they are not adherent to instructions and buying cheap chemicals, which have no effect on the pest.<br /><br />On what farmers need to do to contain the pest, he said the most efficient strategy for now was for farmers to use premium chemical and not necessarily going for the cheap one, adding that the ones that are really working are the premium chemicals.<br /><br />He said: “there are some chemicals that are effectively taking care of armyworm, and that a litre of it cost about N10,000. However, the other chemicals sold at N1000 and N1200, when farmers use that one, that have to include potency to it. But other chemicals like sharpshooter, if they use it, it will take care of armyworm. These chemicals are proven to be taking care of armyworm over the years.<br /><br />“Armyworm is not new. As at 1995, there was army worm. I have experienced armyworm before. It is not anything new.<br /><br />What farmers need to is to just adherent to instructions as there is no big deal with army worm. All those biological control maybe okay but they are not practical. The biological control may incur additional cost, which farmers can not afford because nobody is helping them anywhere.<br /><br />The Executive Director, GoGreen Africa Initiative, Ambassador Adeniyi Bunmi said that the army worm has been around now and it has become something else.<br />According to him one thing African farmers need to do is to understand the proper agronomy procedure because most people don’t do the proper thing.<br /><br />He explained that farmers needs to do a proper land preparation such that when they plant their maize, and immediately notice any evaporation in their maize leaves between 5th and 10th days, farmers need to start applying&nbsp; pesticides. He stated that farmers should make sure the pesticides are directly dropped into leaves holes because armyworm just lay their eggs there, expand and eat into the stem of the maize.<br /><br />He added: “It is not that your maize will not grow but they will not produce very well. What we are able to do like every three, three days, we keep applying different pesticides because those things get used to a particular pesticide at a time. But we were able to fight them health longer and able to eradicate it in our pilot farm. Since then I have been teaching farmers best ways to apply this thing not waiting till you begin to see the armyworm.<br />“So it has been work for me and other people that follow the procedure. But there are lot of chemicals out there that claim to tackle armyworm the bulk of which are not really working.<br /><br />When you blend one or two together, you may get a result but we are still clamouring for permanent solution,” he added.<br /><br />He said: “For me, my farmers and students, what we are able to do using different pesticides. We didn’t rely on one pesticides, we were just mixing like three pesticides together and fortunately, we were able to overcome them.”<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbta styvenchy@yahoo.com 08033302331&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), has called on countries to adopt policies to protect bees and other pollinators to avert eventual drop in food diversity. FAO’s Director-General, José Graziano da Silva, made the call in Slovenia, at an official ceremony to mark World Bee Day.<br /><br />Graziano da Silva, said policies must be promulgated to safeguard insects and other pollinators as a sure way in forestalling the occurrence of food shortage in the near future.<br /><br />He added: “We cannot continue to focus on increasing production and productivity based on the widespread use of pesticides and chemicals that are threatening crops and pollinators. “Each one of us has an individual responsibility towards protecting bees and we should all make pollinator-friendly choices. Even growing flowers at home to feed bees contributes to this effort,” he added.<br /><br />On the benefits of pollinators, the DG said pollinators, such as bees, wild bees, birds, bats, butterflies and beetles fly, that hop and crawl over flowers to help plants fertilize are sadly declining in numbers and diversity.<br /><br />He noted that pollinators’ numbers and diversity have declined in the past decades, and evidence indicates that the decline is primarily a consequence of human activities including climate change which can disrupt flowering seasons. “It has become imperative to safeguard the bees because more than 75 per cent of the world’s food crops rely, to some extent, on pollination for yield and quality.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G_5vqUfkK08/Wwu7cXwlT5I/AAAAAAAABoc/N7VejxL-wW0N_iprKhrzCbItWz6ftsHZgCLcBGAs/s1600/WFP.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"153\" data-original-width=\"329\" height=\"148\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-G_5vqUfkK08/Wwu7cXwlT5I/AAAAAAAABoc/N7VejxL-wW0N_iprKhrzCbItWz6ftsHZgCLcBGAs/s320/WFP.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said that without bees and other pollinators, there would most certainly be food shortage as crops like coffee, apple, almond and others that require pollination would be unavailable.<br /><br />Graziano da Silva noted that the panacea to the dwindling percentage of bees and other pollinators can only be solved through sustainable agriculture practices, agro-ecology, reduction in the use of pesticides and diversification of the economy.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

As a farmer, you need to consider the strength of your seeds. There are a number of good seed varieties from IAR Zaria. Planting hybrid seeds that grow faster, stronger, and having greater efficiency will boost your maize yield.<br /><br /><b>Know when to start planting</b><br /><br />first, if you are a commercial farmer, it is important to note that there are tests to determine suitability of planting time. Choosing the right time to plant is often the most important part of planting. Early planting has the potentials to increase your yield.<br /><br /><b>Ensure weeds are dealt with early</b><br /><br />Weeds are the number one enemy of crops and can sabotage your farmland because they siphon nutrients away from the crops you are trying to grow.

The root-zone at the base of your crops is the most important area to facilitate growth so your corn can thrive and produce an impressive yield.<br /><br /><b>Walk round your farm regularly&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Learn to always walk on your fields on foot. This will give you a chance to assess soil conditions, notice any weeds cropping up, and check that your crops are growing well.<br /><br /><b>Prevent waterlogging and salinization</b><br /><br />Your farm water management is crucial to your maize’s yield and so preventing waterlogging and salinization in your soil, both of which can stifle growth and production.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Food self-sufficiency: Local Fertiliser Production Raises Hopes",
    "content": "<br />Nigeria’s chances of achieving food self-sufficiency is brightening by the day as farmers now have improved access to timely, affordable and high-quality fertiliser in commercial quantity. This is courtesy of the implementation of the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative and other strategic policies on the revitalisation of fertiliser blending plants. But, stakeholders in the agricultural sector believe the sustainability of policy is key to the restoration of Nigeria as West Africa’s food basket. Assistant Editor CHIKODI OKEREOCHA reports.<br /><br />It is probably the most proactive, result-driven step taken to ward off likely food crisis. Even before experts projected that Nigeria’s population will hit 400 million by 2050, making it the third most populous country in the world, the Federal Government is articulating a number of policy initiatives aimed at meeting the nation’s food requirement and hopefully, ending the food importation regime.<br /><br />The Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI), the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP), the Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and the Agriculture Promotion Policy (APP) are some of policies initiated to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and consumption, and ultimately, reposition Nigeria as a food basket in the sub-region.<br /><br />The revolution in the agricultural sector began in December 2016 when the Federal Government set up the PFI as part of efforts to deliver commercially-significant quantities of affordable and high-quality fertiliser at the right time to farmer.<br /><br />A year and five months down the line, the fertiliser blending industry is gradually bouncing back. As at the last count, 11 fertiliser blending plants have been revitalised following the implementation of the initiative.<br /><br />Drawing attention to the feat, Information, Culture &amp;Tourism Minister Lai Mohammed said the PFI delivered 10 million 50kg bags (500, 000MT) of Nitrogen, Phosphorous and Potassium (NPK) 20:10:10 to fertiliser for the wet season in 2017.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZWFukjnjSkQ/Wv6xhSeHvgI/AAAAAAAABnY/_GyMMrVFngUc3S9pfQSAq0QmkCxoWv1nACLcBGAs/s1600/Production.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZWFukjnjSkQ/Wv6xhSeHvgI/AAAAAAAABnY/_GyMMrVFngUc3S9pfQSAq0QmkCxoWv1nACLcBGAs/s320/Production.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The icing on the cake for farmers was the fact that the fertiliser came at a pocket-friendly price of N5, 500.<br /><br />Mohammed said the N5, 500 per 50kg bag price tag represented a 40 per cent reduction from the price of N9, 000 in 2016. He said that more than six million bags of fertiliser have been sold to farmers at the subsidised rate.<br /><br />Prior to the PFI, the government was subsidising ever bag of imported fertiliser to the tune of N6, 000.<br /><br />The price slash was the fulfilment of a promise by Agriculture &amp; Rural Development Minister Audu Ogbe, who assured that a bag of fertiliser would be sold for below N6, 000 following an agreement between the Federal Government Morocco on supplies.ý<br /><br />“We signed an agreement with the Moroccan Government. We went to Morocco and had a good agreement for phosphate imports.ý With phosphate importation, we will put fertiliser on the market for less than N6, 000,” Ogbe said, in Kano, in 2017.<br /><br />Nigeria, Morocco fertiliser deal was game changer<br /><br />&nbsp;The Nation learnt that the changing fortunes of the fertiliser blending industry and by extension, the agricultural sector, where the government is pushing to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and consumption, was largely as a result of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) it signed with Morocco in 2016 to produce fertiliser locally.”<br /><br />The deal with the Moroccan government was for the supply of phosphate to ensure the production of one million tons of fertliser locally. The agreement was anchored by the FEPSAN and OCP, a state-owned company in Morocco. It is a world leader in phosphate and its derivatives.<br /><br />The MoU signed King Mohammed VI of Morocco visited Nigeria, also sought to promote the use of agricultural inputs, including access to adequate fertilisers as a major lever for improving agricultural productivity and farmers’ income.<br /><br />Before the MoU, the blending capacity of the Nigerian fertiliser industry was put at four million tons of NPK annually and two million tons of production capacity for Urea, with capacity to employ over 250, 000 people in both direct and indirect jobs across the country.<br /><br />But, with less than 10 per cent of these production capacities being utilised, the government opted for the MoU, the areas of collaboration which included securing a supply of quality fertilisers by bringing in the raw materials required for production in line with the crops and soils adaptability.<br /><br />The collaboration also aimed at strengthening the local blending capabilities by leveraging on technical know-how and engineering skills, as well as stimulating product innovation and development through the deployment of the Moroccan expertise in scientific production of recommended formulae adaptable to the Nigerian soil.<br /><br />It also sought to strengthen the capacity to ensure a timely supply of quality fertiliser in adequate quantities and in a cost-effective manner to rural areas as well as an efficient supply chain and improvement of logistics management.<br /><br />Others areas of collaboration included warehousing and transportation services and the strengthening of the nation’s agricultural extension services system.<br /><br />The intervention is said to have increased local production of the input, ramping it up from a mere 500, 000 metric tonnes before 2015 to 2.22 million MT.<br /><br />On the gains of the deal, Mohammed said the PFI saved the government N60 billion in would-be subsidies last year.<br /><br />The minister put the foreign exchange (forex) savings for the period at $150 million, attributing it to the substitution of imported inputs of NPK with locally-sourced inputs.<br /><br />Limestone and Urea were sourced locally, phosphate was imported from Morocco. The locally-sourced inputs were triggered the revival of 11 moribund fertiliser blending plants.<br /><br />The 11 revitalised blending plants, according to Mohammed, have a combined capacity of over two million metric tonnes. He informed that 12 more blending plants would be revived to bring the number to 23 this year.<br /><br />The minister added that PFI targets the delivery of 20 million 50kg bags (about one million MT) this year. It is twice the figure for 2017.<br /><br />Rolling out the multiplier effects of the reactivation of the fertiliser blending plants, Mohammed said that the noticeable upsurge in patronage was due to the movement of raw materials and finished goods.<br /><br />He also said the bag-making sector of the economy has received a boost, with over 10 million packaging bags produced exclusively for PFI. About 60,000 direct jobs have also been created, while several indirect jobs have been churned out.<br /><br />In Ogbe’s view, about six million jobs have been created in the agricultural sector within two years.<br /><br />Presenting his ministry’s scorecard and target for the year in Abuja, Ogbe said the six million jobs were created both on and off farms as a result of the huge increase in local rice production.<br /><br />He said: “We are exporting more than we are importing now and most of our exports are agro-products. We are growing in agriculture and from the middle of this year, whoever chooses to eat Thailand rice is welcomed to pay duties. We shall impose duties on it because we consider it a wasteful luxury and something this country can’t afford.”<br /><br />Assuring that the government will not compromise on the quality and control of produce for export and local consumption, the minister added that fertiliser blending would be improved to accommodate micro nutrients in the agro-products.<br /><br />The journey from scarcity<br /><br />The non-availability of affordable fertiliser remained the challenge to Nigeria’s quest for increased productivity in the agricultural sector for a very long time. The dearth of this critical input was a disincentive to farmers’ efforts to contribute to economic diversification through small, medium and large scale agriculture.<br /><br />The activities of black marketers compounded the woes. Adding to that were the powerful middlemen, who ensured that the critical farming input ever reached the farmers from the government. They were in charge of the fertiliser distribution chain for decades and they blocked the end-users’ access to subsidised inputs, particularly fertiliser.<br /><br />Investigation showed that fertiliser, which could have lifted the farmers’ effort at contributing to food security, job and wealth creation, were brazenly sold in the open market or smuggled into neighbouring West African countries where they sold at exorbitant prices.<br /><br />The fertiliser racketeering was hurting efforts at leveraging large-scale agric to achieve food self-sufficiency.<br /><br />To President Muhammadu Buhari, who has set a next year target to end food importation, the situation was disturbing.&nbsp; But, his administration’s was determined to change the narrative.<br /><br />Eyeing the export market<br /><br />Encouraged by the revitalisation of the fertiliser industry, Nigeria now has her eyes set on claiming a substantial share of the global fertliser market, staring from the West African sub-region where it plans to reclaim her position as food basket.<br /><br />Excited by the bright prospects in the fertiliser industry, the Chairman of FEPSAN, Mr. Thomas Etuh, said Nigeria will begin to export fertiliser in the next two years.<br /><br />According to him, Nigeria is already selling fertiliser to Benin Republic, Chad, Cameroon and Niger Republic, saying that the development will restore Nigeria’s position as the food basket of the West African sub-region.<br /><br />Etuh, who spoke in Abuja, recently, commended Buhari for initiating the PFI, noting that it has helped farmers access to critical agricultural input at affordable prices.<br /><br />He said this has reduced farmers’ overheads, boost yield and encourage more players to invest in the agricultural value chain.<br /><br />Etuh recalled that before the PFI, Nigeria had 32 fertiliser blending plants most of which were moribund, explaining that out of the 33 plants, five were functional.<br /><br />The five were producing at 10 per cent capacity because of the emphasis on importation.<br /><br />The FEPSAN expressed optimism on the resuscitation of the fertiliser industry and that Nigeria will play a more dominant role in the region and indeed, the global industry, on government’s ability to sustain the current gains of the PFI.<br /><br />Noting that the journey towards food security may have started with the huge impact of the PFI programme, he called on the government to sustain the current political will that has made it possible for the initiative to become a huge success.<br /><br />Pan-African investor Alhaji Aliko Dangote is no less excited by the prospects of Nigeria becoming Africa’s largest exporter of fertiliser.<br /><br />Like Etuh and other key industry operators, Dangote admitted that things have changed in the agricultural sector.<br /><br />Speaking on April 30, after Buhari’s meeting with a group of agricultural business firms in the United States (U.S.), Dangote expressed optimism that Nigeria will soon become the biggest exporter of fertiliser in the continent.<br /><br />Food production ramps up<br /><br />According to Etuh, the volume of food production of staples like rice and maize has increased in the last two years. He traced the development to the affordability and availability of fertiliser.<br /><br />The FEPSAN chairman got it right. There has been an exponential growth in local rice production, as the government has banned rice importation.<br /><br />Within two years, rice importation from Thailand fell from 644,131 MT in September 2015 to 20, 000 MT in September last year, representing more than 90 per cent drop.<br /><br />Nigeria’s paddy rice production has also seen significant growth in the past three years – from four million MT to seven million MT.<br /><br />The government plans to achieve self-sufficiency in paddy rice production by 2020, even as the country’s rice import bill, which hitherto stood at $1.65 billion annually, has dropped by over 90 per cent.<br /><br />Confirming the quantum leap in local rice production, the Rice Processors Association of Nigeria (RIPAN) said that the number of rice farmers rose to more than 11 million from five million in 2015.<br /><br />The changing fortunes of the sector are also evident from the investment and job creation perspectives as RIPAN’s put the investment portfolio in the local economy in excess of N300 billion. Upcoming investments have been projected to hit N250 billion soon.<br /><br />The new investments are expected to add 5, 000 jobs and additional 1,775,000 MT of integrated rice milling capacity. They will also save $300 million in foreign exchange from import substitution through local processing.<br /><br />Nigeria’s current rice consumption is put at approximately six million MT last year, up from the 2.5 million MT it produced in 2015.<br /><br />The EGRP, ABP impact<br /><br />A multi-pronged policy response is needed for the government to achieve its food self-sufficiency target. Apart from the PFI, the Federal Government also launched the ERGP in April 2017. The medium-term<br /><br />plan, charts a course for the economy over a four-year period – 2017–2020.<br /><br />The vision of the ERGP is to restore economic growth, invest in Nigerians and to build a globally competitive economy.<br /><br />It has a target to achieve these by focusing on five execution priorities: stabilising the macroeconomic environment; achieving agriculture and food security, ensuring energy efficiency (especially in power and petroleum products); improving transportation infrastructure; and driving industrialisation primarily through Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).<br /><br />The ERGP is expected to return the economy to sustainable, inclusive and diversified growth and to transform the country from an import-dependent to a producing economy; a country that grows what it eats and consumes what it produces.<br /><br />The ERGP prioritises food security and aims to achieve self-sufficiency in tomato paste, rice and wheat, by 2017,&nbsp; 2018, and 2019/2020 respectively.<br /><br />It projects that the value of agricultural production would increase by 31 per cent to N21 trillion in 2020.<br /><br />Before introducing the EGRP, the government, through the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), unveiled the ABP on November 17, 2015. Its aim was aimed to provide farm inputs, in cash and kind, to smallholder farmers to boost local production of commodities, including rice, stabilize inputs supply to agro-processors and address the country’s negative balance of payments on food.<br /><br />The ABP, combined with a newly developed soil map designed to aid fertiliser application, is said to have substantially raised local production of grains in 2016, with yields improving from two tonnes per hectare to as much as seven tonnes per hectare in some states.<br /><br />It also produced a model agricultural collaboration between Lagos and Kebbi states.<br /><br />Experts say that in the last five years, Nigeria’s share of global food consumption hovered around 3.4 per cent, the highest amongst African countries. They also projected that by 2050,&nbsp; the population will be 400 million, which would make it the third most populous country in the world.<br /><br />Noting that food consumption is expected to grow by at least four per cent per annum – its historical average, they advised on the urgent need to increase production to meet the country’s food requirement and achieve self-sufficiency.<br /><br />The import the wise counsel appears is not lost on the mangers of the nation’s economy. The mangers have come up with proactive policies, aimed at increasing production and value addition across key agricultural food products.<br /><br />That the initiatives have started yielding fruits notwithstanding, the consensus is that the government must demonstrate more political will to sustain the policies.<br /><br /><b>By: Chikodi Okereocha</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Promoting Agriculture as a key Investment for the Future",
    "content": "The feedback I get from readers of this column persuades one to vouch that this country is well endowed with industrious citizens. Nigerians are not lazy and are indeed very creative. However, a lack of awareness of where to direct their energies as well as the lack of institutional commitment to the progress of businesses, especially in the areas of primary production and manufacturing, has greatly discouraged the youth.<br /><br />Some years ago, I was at a farm where the investor had acquired large acres of land, to develop an integrated farm settlement. Eight years later, at the time of my visit, what started as a booming business is now a shadow of itself. Only the ostrich unit remains productively strong because of the hardiness of the birds and the novelty of the niche. The tortoises are also still there because they are cheap to maintain, although there are few buyers. If the farm owner’s dreams of unfolding the tourism aspect of the venture had progressed as envisaged, they would have been attracting revenues for him by now.<br /><br />Like I told him, which is still my conviction, agriculture remains the business of the future and he must not abandon his dreams. I am often told that only about seven per cent of the American population is engaged in agriculture yet they feed their people and export to the world. In our own case, ‘about 60 per cent’ of Nigerians are engaged in agriculture yet cannot meet the food needs of the people. The question is what kind of agricultural production are those ’60 per cent’ engaged in? How profitable and sustainable are their businesses?<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-goDQaSbeHAw/Wur7F6JlWpI/AAAAAAAABh0/bEfw4HhPpBsXI8ClgI5-VpUtVTFiwSdSQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"371\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-goDQaSbeHAw/Wur7F6JlWpI/AAAAAAAABh0/bEfw4HhPpBsXI8ClgI5-VpUtVTFiwSdSQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Farmers.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Most of those included in that so-called 60 per cent are people who farm when there is nothing else to do; and they will keep looking out for ‘real jobs’. When they ram into contracts, they quickly abandon the farms. This disdain for agriculture (by the government and people) is one of the reasons why Nigeria lost at least 15 youths in their quest for non-existent immigration jobs in 2014. It is one reason for rampant industrial unrests in workplaces – because pay cheques cannot meet the food security needs of families; possibly a reason that boarding school systems have virtually collapsed. A clued-up, focused support for agriculture and the business chains that it can spawn will reduce the reasons for corruption by the working class and steer those working at low-paying jobs into viable agricultural enterprises.<br /><br />Government can fund publicity campaigns that sell agriculture, especially untrodden niches. It is also important to help create markets for the products of primary producers. This was a challenge for the enthusiastic farmer mentioned earlier. He sometimes had to sell at give-away prices to enable him pay workers and buy feedstock. It is stressful being both producer and marketer at the same time. It was such debts that finally got him grounded. Government must step in to alleviate farmers’ vulnerability by studiedly setting up markets for diverse agricultural produce including livestock.<br /><br />Visits to farms need to be included in the excursion programmes of all schools and students of agriculture need to, as part of their training, go and work in farms – not only the ones owned by Generals and multinationals, but also other medium and small -scale farms. This will not only offer practical and realistic exposure to the students, but also provide farmhands to support agricultural production.<br /><br />During my youth service in 1989, we were made to ‘work ‘at a large poultry farm in Ipaja, Lagos every Friday but it turned out to be our happy TGIF day because there were no birds in the farm; only a stench that greeted you as you approached the place. This was quite off-putting at a stage when we should have been posted to thriving farms (no matter how small) to whet our desire for farm ventures. Many years later, while living in Kaduna, I tried poultry farming and found it very profitable, at least, until the bird flu hoax in 2007 ruined our investments. Government did nothing to cushion the losses faced by poultry farmers during that sad season. Eleven years on, one wonders at the extant status of agricultural insurance in the country.<br /><br />Institutional support for agriculture would also include the promotion of new ideas. Mandates of research institutes should be expanded to consider new areas of agricultural venturing, areas that would be readily profitable because of their novelty. Agriculture is only attractive when it is lucrative and innovation is one of the titivating factors. A fund should be developed for this purpose.<br /><br />Following previous write-ups promoting ostrich farming, a reader who has been into traditional livestock like poultry and piggery called to ask how he can branch out into this new area, recognising that diversification is the essence of good business. Nigeria has a lot to benefit from developing this area as ostriches have been globally identified as the livestock of the future with the potential to rake in more profits than cattle and other customary livestock.<br /><br /><b><span style=\"color: blue;\">jenihuomabraham@yahoo.com</span></b><br /><b>08148137781</b><br /><br /><b>By: Jennifer Abraham</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

There are several strains of brucella bacteria occurring in cows, dogs, pigs, sheep, goats and camels which could be spread to humans.<br /><br />Brucellosis in humans occurs when a person comes into contact with an animal or animal product infected with the brucella bacteria.<br /><br />It is worthy to note that brucella in animals cannot be cured although there are vaccines against brucellosis which are effective for cattle, sheep and goats. However there is no vaccine available for humans.<br /><br />www.webmd.com reports that brucellosis is considered a significant health threat in some parts of the world. The World Health Organisation (WHO) reports that brucellosis was reported in more than a half-million people each year in 100 countries.<br /><br />It is uncommon and very rare for the bacteria to spread from person to person but could be spread to babies via breastfeeding by infected mothers and also through sexual contact.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cFOjWNOQ6Qg/Wv2VNJINzGI/AAAAAAAABnA/-v1l47lR6LwwCRQConMeryqnd3SCChpOwCLcBGAs/s1600/Brucellous.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"394\" data-original-width=\"590\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cFOjWNOQ6Qg/Wv2VNJINzGI/AAAAAAAABnA/-v1l47lR6LwwCRQConMeryqnd3SCChpOwCLcBGAs/s320/Brucellous.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Other ways of getting infected by the disease is by eating or drinking contaminated food or drink, such as unpasteurised milk or undercooked meat or by travelling to areas where brucellosis is common.<br /><br />Persons that work in meat-processing plant or slaughterhouses are also at risk of getting infected with the disease. It can also infect humans through cuts in the skin, through mucous membranes or by inhalation.<br /><br />General symptoms of brucellosis are often imprecise and similar to the flu and typically appear within five to 30 days after contact with the bacteria.<br /><br />Meanwhile, www.medicinenet.com reports that in general, the prognosis for patients infected with brucella is very good.<br /><br />Prevention of brucellosis is possible by avoiding contact with infected animals and consumption or unpasteurised milk and cheese products. Where contact is necessary with infected animals, gloves and facemask should be worn to reduce the risk of getting infected.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />NIHORT trains 400 farmers, says horticultural crops can grow Nigeria’s GDP<br /><br />The National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT) has projected that a committed national policy on mass production of plantain and pineapple is capable of contributing 10 percent significant growth to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in the next five years.<br /><br />Speaking at a two-day empowerment and training programme for 400 farmers on horticultural (plantain and pineapple) value chain, the Director of Training, NIHORT, Dr. Lawrence Olajide Taiwo, said that agriculture currently contributes 24% to the nation’s GDP, without the input of horticultural crops.<br /><br />The training session which was opened on Monday in Kwale, Ndokwa West Local Government Area of Delta State, drew trainees from the three Local Government Areas of Ndokwa/Ukwuani federal constituency.<br /><br />He said that the training programme would be extended to the Ika North East and Ika South LGAs because the people of the areas were predominantly farmers and would be exposed to various sources of making money from plantain and pineapple.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UuY3uzgqG_w/Wv2USxrGB2I/AAAAAAAABmw/0IFBtwcwHvAattytpxSQBb3SQ_Z9BkoVQCLcBGAs/s1600/NIHORT.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"608\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"294\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-UuY3uzgqG_w/Wv2USxrGB2I/AAAAAAAABmw/0IFBtwcwHvAattytpxSQBb3SQ_Z9BkoVQCLcBGAs/s320/NIHORT.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;Olajide, who is also the programme coordinator, said the training would expose participants on what it takes to cultivate plantain and pineapple through processing and maintenance and marketing to make money.<br /><br />“Here in Delta, we are going to train 400 farmers on horticultural value chain. In the next five years, if we continue the way we are going, horticulture will add about 10 per cent to whatever agriculture adds to the country’s GDP,” said.<br /><br />On his part, Dr Dr. Abayomi Akeem Olaniyan, Ag Executive Director, NIHORT, said that plantain and pineapple were important horticultural commodities, adding that horticulture remained source of household income, employment generation, enhanced GDP and government revenue.<br /><br />Declaring the training programme open, the initiator of the project, Hon. Ossai Nicholas Ossai, a member representing Ndokwa/Ukwuani federal constituency, said the training would expose the participants on new area of making money particularly by converting the waste products of plantain for making of soap and pomade.<br /><br />“We have engaged the experts from the National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT) to train the farmers in various ways of growing plantain suckers, pineapple suckers and utilising these crops for different purposes,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By Victor Sorokwu,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Last week, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh said the Federal Government was scrapping the Growth Enhancement Scheme (GES) - an initiative of the Jonathan administration in which farmers get subsidized farm inputs through text massages.<br /><br />A new programme, Agricultural Inputs and Mechanization Scheme (AIMS), will now replace the GES programme.<br /><br />Chief Ogbeh, while unveiling the SMART Model Farm Site by John Deere Tractors Manufacturing Company at Gwagwalada in Abuja, reiterated that the scheme could no longer be sustained, because most state governments failed to comply with the 25% counterpart fund for their farmers resulting in the accumulation of huge debts by the Federal Government.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IVOgjLdkzJI/WdcyYkEjA7I/AAAAAAAAAQY/APCQgjPhOxYv5hh7ImwsVNa0zux3hwMBQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu%2BOgbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IVOgjLdkzJI/WdcyYkEjA7I/AAAAAAAAAQY/APCQgjPhOxYv5hh7ImwsVNa0zux3hwMBQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu%2BOgbeh.jpg\" /></a></div>Under the GES, state governments and the Federal Government were to pay 25% each while the farmer paid 50% of the cost of inputs that were mostly two bags of fertilizer and seeds.<br /><br />It could be recalled that the present administration inherited debts totaling about N76 billion owed agro-dealers for input they supplied in the last two farming seasons ahead of election.<br /><br />Although it has paid some of the debt, the government still owes agro-dealers - a situation that has put many of them (dealers) in trouble with their banks.<br /><br />The minister also said that some of the claims were dubiously inflated, which was responsible for the high figures that were even bigger than the budget of the ministry. He added however that “we are still paying.”<br /><br />On the new programme (Agricultural Inputs and Mechanisation Services, AIMS) that is replacing the GES, he said two centres would be established in all the 774 local government areas of the country in collaboration with the Association of Tractor Owners and Hiring Facility of Nigeria (TOFAN) to get the vital inputs and services to farmers in the federation.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A Yusuf&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The production of wheat in Jigawa State dropped by about 65 percent this year, investigation by Daily Trust in the state has shown.<br /><br />Multiple sources&nbsp; that spoke with our correspondent in the state attributed the ugly situation to pest’s infestation, late cropping and drop in the number of farmers as majority of them could not repay the loans for agricultural inputs distributed by the state government in the previous farming seasons.<br /><br />Our reporter learnt that the state government had early this year stopped the loan scheme until full recovery of the previous disbursements was made.<br /><br />Competent sources in the state told our reporter that defaulting civil servants, who engaged in farming last year and benefited from the loan, are now paying through a compulsory deduction from their salaries.<br /><br />One of the sources said the authorities are at present working on how to handover defaulters that are not civil servants to the police for the recovery of the loan.<br /><br />The state chairman of the Wheat Farmers Association, Abdullahi Waek, told Daily Trust that during the last farming season, over 12,000 tons of wheat was produced in the state but that the figure reduced drastically to only about 5,000 tons this year.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gu7YqobgMZ4/WhbaJBUIEzI/AAAAAAAAA0A/VxJ451Ltb-UUsytWZ9NBnm7GiqItWvk9wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Wheat%2BGrains.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Gu7YqobgMZ4/WhbaJBUIEzI/AAAAAAAAA0A/VxJ451Ltb-UUsytWZ9NBnm7GiqItWvk9wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Wheat%2BGrains.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Though, defaulting in the repayment of the loan is largely the reason for the sudden sharp fall in the production of the crop, Waek also said late planting of the crop also contributed as many farmers planted late in January instead of October/November.<br /><br />Daily Trust reports that last year, improved seed variety, pumping machines, fertilizer and other agricultural inputs were given as loan to the farmers by the state government under the agreement that they&nbsp; would pay back in cash shortly after harvest.<br /><br />Repayment problem began when at the end of the harvest season, farmers realized that they would have to sell two bags of their farm produce before they could generate enough money to repay for one bag of seed they collected as loan.<br /><br />‘’It is on this premise that the farmers, in contrast to the agreement of the loan, asked government to collect the produce in lieu of money. That will enable them to make repayment of one bag of seed with a bag of their produce but the government rejected the proposal,’’ the chairman of the state Wheat Farmers Association, Abdullahi Waek, explained.<br /><br />Waek, said lack of knowledge on how to cultivate the crop also affected the farmers, noting that wheat was not cultivated on any kind of farm because unlike rice, it did not require too much water.<br /><br />“Owing to these reasons, the population of wheat farmers also dropped from over 10,000 to about 3,000 across the state.<br /><br />“Majority of civil servants, who defaulted, are now on compulsory repayment as deductions are being made from their salaries while for those that are not civil servants they will be handed over to the police to ensure full recovery.<br /><br />“These are among what affected wheat farming in the state,’’ he explained.<br /><br />Daily Trust further learnt that the issue of off-takers has also remained a problem for wheat farmers in the state, though the leader of the wheat farmers in the state said some flour mills have now indicated interest in the commodity, which gives them a ray of hope of better price.<br /><br />The chairman of Wheat farmers in Ringim Local Government Area of the state, Hamisu Salisu Dabi, said the outbreak of pest on wheat crop this year affected the level of production in the local government, adding that a farmer that harvested 10 bags of wheat the previous season could barely get two bags this year.<br /><br />Governor Muhammad Badaru Abubakar had told journalists in the state that the drop in production could be largely attributed to poor seeds; adding, however that government was working on how to produce its own seed for the farmers.<br /><br /><b>By Aliyu M.

    "title": "Inside theWworld of Beekeeping",
    "content": "<br />Mere mention of bees brings honey to mind. Many do not know that there are other beneficial uses the bees could be put to.<br /><br />Truth is that investment in honey bee farming has remained largely under-explored given the rising demand for honey for industrial, medical and home use across the globe.<br /><br />One of the few farmers in the sector in the South East, Emeka Okafor whose honey bee business, Majestic Honey Farms is at Adazi Enu in Aniocha Local Government Area of Anambra State has graphically explained the various uses of honey, the medicinal value and economic importance.<br /><br />Okafor who is popularly known as ‘Emeka Mmanu Anu’ (Emeka Honey) said he is in the business of domestication of African honey bees for the production of natural honey, bee wax, honey comb and what he called apetherapy services.<br /><br />Having been in the business for more than a decade, Okafor, according to his explanations, has gained a whole lot of experience about the usefulness of honey in diverse ways.<br />One strange benefit of bees, the bee farmer said, is that an ailment like paralysis or stroke could easily be cured by bee stings.<br /><br />“The process is using bee stings at that particular part of the body that is lifeless. You will allow a concentration of bee stings there. It is controlled. When you expose that part of the patient’s body like a period of two months, life returns to that part of the body, no matter how long the patient has suffered the stroke or its gravity. That is a natural cure that no orthodox medicine could counter. India, China and some other countries use this method and it works. Its efficacy is not in doubt. I gained the experience from an expert who was trained in Israel in honey bee farming from who I received my training,” Okafor posited.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IkIsUy5jGcA/Wvv9X_p9PiI/AAAAAAAABmg/uUFcnVrflOIEWm-wwodTc1jLNm6SSULTACLcBGAs/s1600/Bee.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"246\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IkIsUy5jGcA/Wvv9X_p9PiI/AAAAAAAABmg/uUFcnVrflOIEWm-wwodTc1jLNm6SSULTACLcBGAs/s1600/Bee.jpg\" /></a></div><br />He said that about 1,000 bees could be deployed to sting the patient for one month, taking an average of 20 bee stings a day; explaining that the therapy would continue for two months until the patient is healed. According to him, many lives had been saved through the therapy, even though it had not been well exploited in the world of curative medicine.<br /><br />African bees, he explained, are of high medicinal value than bees from other continents because their domestication takes natural course devoid of artificial materials.<br /><br />Giving insight into how bees are attracted to his farms, Okafor said: “The method is to get fruits like pineapple, mangoes, palm wine and other sweet-smelling objects to attract the bees to the colony. The moment they visit the colony and see other bees, they will return to the colony after feeding in the wild.”<br /><br />As someone close to the bees, Okafor said he discovered another property of the bees and their attitudinal behaviour to safeguard their environment. He said that bees use their propolis to embalm their enemies like lizard, rat on the grounds of intrusion into the bees’ territory. The essence of the embalmment by the bees is to avoid the body of the dead animals from oozing foul odour to disturb them within their environment.<br /><br />He also disclosed that bees are sensitive with high level of alertness within their environment; pointing out that they could be sensitive to smells and colours. In his observation, colours like red, black and blue make them aggressive when such colours are brought close to them, adding that bees also hate external noise.<br /><br />In addition, Okafor said that bee propolis is an antibiotic that could be used to treat various kinds of diseases in humans including treatment of wounds, as well as infertility problems in women which he said is very effective.<br />He identified bee wax as a product for production of shoe polish after extracting the honey, material for wood preservation, used to produce chewing gum and varieties of other products.<br /><br />He explained that his incursion into bee-keeping started some years ago when after his Higher National Diploma programme, he decided that he would not roam the streets in search of job.<br /><br />“I visited Mazube Farms in Minna, Niger State. There, I had contact with some Israelis who are experts in beekeeping industry. I was trained in beekeeping business and all the dos and don’ts in it. After a period of time there, I came back to my village to start my own business. I have invented an automated machine to suppress bee aggression; and I control so many bee colonies,” he stated.<br /><br />Because of high demand for honey, Okafor is of the view that government must intervene to develop the industry. The demand for original honey, he said, surpasses the supply by 1,000 per cent.<br /><br />He maintained that the country would earn millions of dollars annually from honey export thereby increasing its Gross National Product (GNP), if beekeeping is well developed.<br /><br /><b>By: David Onwuchekwa, Nnewi</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Situating Nigeria’s Agric Potential",
    "content": "Recently, the Speaker of the House of Reps, Yakubu Dogara, caused a buzz when he was shown visiting his expansive farm showcasing diverse crops including animal husbandry. The import of that media blitz of the Speaker’s is that the elite clearly understands that agriculture holds the key to sustainable development.<br /><br />Before Dogara’s, we are witnesses to President Muhammadu Buhari showcasing his herd of cattle most times when he is in his hometown of Daura. The cheering news about this is that it is not just the elite that are given to the idea of investing in agriculture. We have entertainers like music star, D’Banj, who has commercialized his farm produce with the popular Koko garri, actress Halima Abubakar, veteran actor Yinka Quadri, the ‘jaga-jaga’ crooner, Eedris Abdulkareem, film producer and actor, Taiwo Hassan amongst a host of others.<br /><br />In an interview not too long ago, D’Banj was quoted as saying: “I engage in agriculture personally to encourage millions of African youths who look up to me as a role model. I need to let them know that unlike the old stereotype of farming which was considered as a form of punishment, modern farming on the contrary, is a cool source of employment for many graduates. Agriculture is life and it is everything that we live for. It is the only way forward for us in Africa. There are so many potentials in it and if we could focus on it, the continent can actually feed the rest of the world.”<br /><br />Nothing can be farther from the truth that the value chain in agriculture is immense if properly harnessed.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LnJNQDYQThk/WvQltLW_d7I/AAAAAAAABkU/YFmFdu6FzYonuUV0U7AqhZKHk6ovHaKqACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Planting.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"371\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LnJNQDYQThk/WvQltLW_d7I/AAAAAAAABkU/YFmFdu6FzYonuUV0U7AqhZKHk6ovHaKqACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Planting.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Let’s take the case of former journalist Rotimi Williams who is reputed to own the second largest commercial farm rice in the country. Williams, 35, has a farm that measures 45, 000 hectares in Nasarawa state and employs more than 600 indigenes of the state without counting the spiral effect of the job creation and investment in the area and beyond.<br /><br />As a country that consumes more than 5 million metric tons of rice every year, with a significant portion from imports, people like Williams are exemplars that with the right policy by government, the country’s quest for self-sufficiency is possible after all.<br /><br />It is in this regard that the Federal Government’s Anchor Borrowers Programme powered by the Central Bank is a vital instrument. The significant aspect of the intervention, which I find compelling, is seeing agriculture as a business driven venture and not simply as a subsistence endeavour.<br /><br />Therefore, taking the route of business-driven agriculture to the grassroots through the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), by deploying an innovative nation-wide field structure to support 225,000 farmers should be applauded.<br /><br />Under the Project Monitoring Reporting and Remediation Office (PMRO) with units located in each state and the federal capital, the NIRSAL is realizing its core mandate of making agriculture more attractive for private sector investment by de-risking the agricultural value chain.<br /><br />Speaking not too long ago on the importance of the PMRO, Managing Director/CEO of NIRSAL, Aliyu Abdulhameed, explained, “The PMRO structure is very critical to our operations. Agriculture is a field business. They would act as our eyes to ensure that agricultural projects that we facilitate finance for are executed in line with agreed terms and also serve to extend the reach of our interventions.”<br /><br />Despite all of these, they are people who think that it is still a long road to Uhuru, and rightly so. In a country that even productive ventures are seen as tools for political patronage, there is the urgency by these agencies to demonstrate that they are insulated from the vagaries of politics and the shenanigans of politicians.<br /><br />Besides this, policy inconsistency is a major drawback. We have seen government rolling back programmes only to reintroduce them either under a new nomenclature or with slight modifications. In a situation where farmers and investors are unsure of the policy of government for a sector that requires medium and long term planning, then there is little hope of getting the right people to show genuine interest and commitment.<br /><br />While most Nigerians think this government has done well in boosting agricultural entrepreneurship, the new worry centres round President Muhammadu Buhari’s recent visit to President Donald Trump of the United States.<br /><br />On many strategic fronts, the visit is a plus and reinforces the vital nature of Nigeria in global affairs, the nagging doubt of what type of agreement was entered into by the president persists.<br /><br />It is a given that with myriads of security challenges, the country needs the security might of the U.S in tackling the threats of Boko Haram and other existentialist groups but are we counting the cost when there are other alternatives to our common good? In the global agricultural and trade war, countries like Nigeria become pawns in the hands of the major players, therefore, a lot of tact and guile is required if we are to protect our local markets and investors.<br /><br />Without a doubt, the U.S. and China are in a bitter trade war with agricultural produce at the centre of it. It is known that owing to some Trump’s business decisions on Chinese businesses that China is enforcing new tax policies on American agricultural products and to absorb the outcome of the enforcements, President Trump is looking to countries like Nigeria, Argentina and Brazil as buffers.<br /><br />So to sign a deal that will see U.S. agric produce, which by the way are heavily subsidized, flooding the Nigerian market at a time that America is not buying our crude is to adversely undermine the potential of the efforts of government to not only ensure food security, grow our economy and job creation, but to seriously eat into our forex market.<br /><br />What government needs to do is to create a buffer of tax exemptions for farmers and other incentives to keep our farmers afloat while seriously tackling the menace of armed banditry and insurgency on farming communities, as well as properly ensure that all imported produce pay the correct tariffs and duties.<br /><br /><b>By: Mariam Mohammed</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

The Jigawa State government also plans to key into the project that will benefit over 25,000 farmers,” the Minister said.<br /><br />The President used the visit to inaugurate&nbsp; the 42-kilometre Tasheguwa-Guri Road and the 32-kilometre Abunabo-Kadira-Guri Road constructed by the state government to facilitate easier movement and evacuation of farm produce.<br /><br />President Buhari also inaugurated the 250,000 solar-powered water supply scheme which is one out of nine of such projects, that will add nine million litres to daily water supply to Dutse and environs.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "NCAN Partners NSCDC to Tackle Foreigners’ Encroachment at Farm Gates",
    "content": "<br />National Cashew Association of Nigeria (NCAN), has entered into partnership with Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) to tackle foreigners’ encroachment at farm gates across the country.<br /><br />The National President, NCAN, Mr. Tola Faseru, who spoke at the 2018 National Cashew Trade Administration Meeting of the association, which held in Ilorin, Kwara State, recently, said there is urgent need for the nation to checkmate the excesses of foreigners at cashew farm gates.<br /><br />He said checkmating the excesses of foreigners at farm gates became imperative because cashew crop is one of the National Strategic Export Products (NSEPs) adopted to diversify the Nigerian economy away from oil.<br />Faseru noted that the encroachment of foreigners has been causing distractions for local farmers and the consequence has led to low quality products, distortions in the trade, reduced value at the international market and most importantly, lower purchasing power for Nigerian farmers.<br /><br />“The encroachment into farm gates by foreigners is inimical to the value chain system and cuts off our locals from participating in the trade. Expatriates position themselves in the bushes to buy directly from the farmers thereby taking away the much-needed jobs from our people.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BTM23F57qDI/WvlZDryjKXI/AAAAAAAABlI/UOUu6DtVajApkSqWSjxIGyhyZWHRd0e6QCLcBGAs/s1600/Cashew%2B%2B%2526%2BNuts.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"202\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BTM23F57qDI/WvlZDryjKXI/AAAAAAAABlI/UOUu6DtVajApkSqWSjxIGyhyZWHRd0e6QCLcBGAs/s1600/Cashew%2B%2B%2526%2BNuts.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“If our people cannot buy commodities, what else can they do? The livelihood of our people should be protected” he said. He frowned at the practice of foreigners bombarding farm gates to buy cashew and this should stop. The activities of these foreign nationals, he said, could also compromise the security of the country.<br /><br />However, he admonished cashew stakeholders to pay adequate attention to the growth and development of the crop because of the foreign exchange that can be generated from it and the resultant employment opportunities.<br /><br />“Nigeria is rated fourth largest producer of cashew nuts in Africa and seventh in the world. Today, the annual earnings from cashew has risen to $402,050,000 (N145 billion) and we see it growing year in year out with the private sector efforts and the growing government interventions in the sector.”he said.<br /><br />According to Faseru, the cashew trade has become a global industry, which employs about 300,000 people across the country, saying farmers and indeed every player in the value chain should be allowed to get a fair return for their efforts<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigeria-US Agric Deal: Lamentations at Farm Gates",
    "content": "<br />President Muhammadu Buhari on April 30, visited US President Donald Trump following an invitation extended to him to discuss issues affecting Nigeria. Part of the issues on the meetings agenda was also on the interests of the two countries as well as their expectations going forward after they both held a press conference and issued statements thereafter.<br /><br />At the meeting, Trump urged Buhari to remove trade barriers in a move that will allow additional US investment in the country. Trump said the US sends Nigeria more than $1 billion annually in foreign aid and that the US ought to get something in return for its financial contribution.<br /><br />Therefore, Trump hinted that US would be investing substantially in Nigeria if the government could create a level playing field that “we have to, very much, ask for and maybe demand.” After the two leaders put the signing of trade agreement to bed, Trump announced that, “…we’ve discussed about agric trade, we will sell our agric products to Nigeria.That way, it will be good for our (USA) farmers and it will also be good to Nigeria…”<br /><br />Contemptuously, the move has been stoking fire among Nigerian farmers as stakeholders in the agricultural space in the country described the move as the most disastrous discussion that when made public, which will never augur well for Nigeria and the economy. They argued it will double Nigeria’s import bill, which currently stands at $20 billion. This will also mount pressure on the naira.<br /><br />The farmers alleged that it was a bit head scuffing that Buhari looked contented with signing an agreement that opens Nigerian borders to US agric produce, a move, they say, is capable of killing off any gains recorded in Nigeria’s local agriculture.<br />The farmers said by the time the US agric produce start coming in, it would crash the food prices since it is cheaper for the US farmers to produce as government supplies produce in large quantities. They said this would send Nigerian farmers packing. They warned Buhari not to turn Nigeria to a dumping centre for US agric produce.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6n4ibTxcZCc/WvlWdc4pQUI/AAAAAAAABk8/VjQbE91CuXMZdc1kAR2FYZjd5uFKAoadwCLcBGAs/s1600/Buhari.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"200\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6n4ibTxcZCc/WvlWdc4pQUI/AAAAAAAABk8/VjQbE91CuXMZdc1kAR2FYZjd5uFKAoadwCLcBGAs/s1600/Buhari.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Buhari’s decision to dance to Trump’s tune will defeat his government’s hyped fertiliser programme, which encourages farmers to return to farm. Recently, former President Olusegun Obasanjo who spoke in Abeokuta, Ogun State, through his media aide, Kehinde Akinyemi, hit Buhari’s government for encouraging the US to export agricultural products to Nigeria. He said the president achieved nothing as being celebrated by his supporters after meeting with Trump.<br /><br />Though it is not clear yet what agricultural commodities the Americans would be pushing to Nigeria with this new deal, it is noteworthy that America is home of the Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) balcony in agricultural production, which Nigerians have been rejecting over the years.<br /><br />With the deal in place, the question is; what would happen to the Nigerian farmers and workers in the agriculture value chain? Can Nigeria get the American firms to consider local production first in addition to importation?<br />Investigation revealed that Trump struck the deals with Nigeria because China is about to enforce new tax on American agricultural products in the next few weeks and President Trump needs new markets for American farm produce before calling the bluff of China.<br /><br />Farmers alleged that, “Trump approached Nigeria, Brazil and Argentina to take American farm produce in exchange for security deals. Nigeria is the highest consumer of Chinese soybeans in the world. But with Nigeria signing an arms deal that includes military hardware transfer, 12 Tuscanos jets, training and parts, we can cut off China and embrace USA. So thought the President and his team! Trump clearly stated he was not interested in Nigeria’s oil or any other thing but to provide new markets for American farmers that will be affected by Chinese new tariff.”<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, the Deputy Managing Director of Peniel Gerar International Limited, Ojiefoh Enahoro Martins, said it is very unfortunate that Nigeria’s government couldn’t differentiate between trade and investment in agriculture, saying the country needs investors not traders.<br /><br />He bemoaned: “My major concern is the unreasonable and unfruitful chorus promises made by the same government to empower we the farmers. On several occasions, our government has aborted our faith to continue with agriculture. Last time, government allowed importation of maize to Nigeria at the peak of harvest. Because we don’t have workable storage structure, we lost it. We are introducing American GMO products into Nigeria in a large scale and this is a setback healthwise.”<br />He said the Chinese are so organised at a point of increasing tax value for America imported agricultural products so as to help their farmers to thrive and grow their economy.<br /><br />He said: “American farmers are at the profit receiving point while we mourn. They are coming in as traders not as investors. We are against trading deal but subscribe to investors in the agricultural sectors. We have land everywhere; we have farmers that are financially handicapped; what we need now is empowerment of farmers not competitors.”<br /><br />He said farmers need agricultural direct investment deals not agro commodity trading deals, adding that Nigeria’s economy is going to freeze up because the borders are going to be flooded with unhealthy products and 90 per cent of Nigerian regulatory agencies are traditional. America’s ungodly deal is not going to grow our economy but theirs.<br /><br />The Executive Director, GoGreen Africa Initiative, Ambassador Adeniyi Bunmi, said it is unfortunate that Nigeria has what people call policy summersault, noting that today, government will make a policy and tomorrow it brings up another thing.<br /><br />He added: “We know Nigeria as an import-dependent country and one of the things this present government is pushing for is reduction in our level of importation by creating things that can easily get around us so we don’t bring everything in. That is what led to the rise of roadmap whereby everybody started going into rice farming and saying, come, this is something we can plant on our own here.<br /><br />He said the deal would kill the remaining little effort in agribusiness because by the time everything comes in, “we already know that everything imported is far cheaper than what we produce in this country. You will now discover that nobody will want to accept what is being produced or processed in our agric value chain anymore.”<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "High Expectations as Planting Begins",
    "content": "<br />Farmers are expecting to enjoy bumper harvest this year occasioned by the prediction of normal rainfall and adherence to best agronomy practices. This is coming even as climate change is threatening the rainfall pattern across the country.<br /><br />In Benue State, most farmers believe that the rain, which had just begun, was late for the season, but experts think otherwise, as some posited that the downpour was just right on time.<br /><br />Daily Trust reports that earlier this year, the Nigerian Metrological Agency (NIMET)’s annual seasonal rainfall prediction had indicated the probability of bountiful harvest following expected normal rainfall.<br /><br />To this end, farmers are not only required to plant early maturity crops, but are also to take advantage of the plan to be educated, possibly by governments on which type of crops to plant so as to reduce losses and maximise gains.<br /><br />&nbsp;Already, in Benue, farmers have just begun tilling following last week’s rainfall while others have started planting mostly yam, maize and melon.<br /><br />The state’s chairman of the All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Aondona Hembe Kuhe, admitted that the rains started a bit late but that maize and groundnut farmers should expect high yield this season.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LnJNQDYQThk/WvQltLW_d7I/AAAAAAAABkQ/45frV1aZhIMPzgdKFApmONq3WCtgoO2IgCLcBGAs/s1600/Planting.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"371\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LnJNQDYQThk/WvQltLW_d7I/AAAAAAAABkQ/45frV1aZhIMPzgdKFApmONq3WCtgoO2IgCLcBGAs/s320/Planting.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;Kuhe, who expressed worry that the current insecurity in the state had displaced nearly a million farmers from their rural homes, said the desertion of their farms could affect food security in the country.<br /><br />He said if the rains had begun in March, farmers would have produced early maize to sustain food security, noting that, yam should also have been planted earlier, between November and February for proper germination.<br /><br />The AFAN chairman advised farmers to engage in best agronomy practices to guard against diseases which may affect their crops, especially stressing the need for yam farmers to apply right solutions according to the variety of their soils across the state for bumper results.<br /><br />“Diseases will affect yam from the soil due to the rainfall, so farmers should apply right solution as appropriate for soil in different locations of the state,” he said.<br /><br />A farmer, Ogli Sunday, said because the rains began in May did not mean it would affect expected harvest as in his estimation, the timing was alright for his crops such as yam, maize and melon which were still being planted.<br /><br />Sunday urged the state government to urgently supply farmers with genuine fertilisers before the end of this month for bumper harvest to be a reality else the idea of making the produce available in June/July would upset farmers’ expectation.<br /><br />&nbsp;Another farmer in the state, Victor Anyebe, appealed that the state government should urgently provide necessary inputs for the rural farmers to mitigate pests attack on crops and control other diseases so that good harvest can be achieved for food sustainability.<br /><br />In Katsina State, farmers are now set for the take-off of farming activities for this rain-fed season.<br /><br />In Danja, Kafur and Malumfashi, many of the farmers have taken the advantage of the early rains to till, plough or harrow their lands. Majority are on the stage of farm clearance while in Sabuwa/Dandume axis some of the farmers have already planted.<br /><br />&nbsp;Malam Sabitu Dabai, a rice farmer in Danja, told this reporter that what the farmers are waiting for in the area is enough rainfall for planting to take off.<br /><br />“Early planting is sacrosanct in rain-fed farming because one cannot dictate the frequency and volume of the rainfall but to plant too early is also dangerous and that is why we are awaiting for the rain to begin in earnest,” he explained.<br /><br />Sabitu Dabai also hinted that rice and maize were the dominant crops to be planted in his area this year.<br /><br />&nbsp;“Just like last year, the trend will repeat itself because many farmers prefer to cultivate food crops, especially rice and maize because of their high yield,” he said.<br /><br />In Kafur, a maize farmer, Bashir Tasi’u Mahuta, said compared to last year, this farming season is starting late.<br /><br />“Last year by now, many of us have planted our farms but with the little rain we got, we are now harrowing our farms for the soil to become spongy and keep moisture,” he explained.<br /><br />He added that through the Federal Government’s Anchor Borrower initiative, many farmers in the area have accessed farm inputs for maize and rice farming this year.<br /><br />“Farmers that benefitted from the scheme, particularly from the rural areas have booked their fertilizer and seeds for maize and rice farming this year while some in the urban areas are selling the inputs at reduced price,” he said.<br /><br />Malam Tasi’u further explained that some farmers in the rural areas were left out of the scheme because they had no bank account or BVN.<br /><br />“Because there was no proper orientation among rural farmers, many of them have no business with banks and as such, they have no bank accounts or BVN. The strict formal documentations for enrolling into the banking system have barred some of the rural farmers that showed interest,” he added.<br /><br />In Malumfashi, many farmers are in the clearance stage with cotton stems seen in the farms.<br /><br />Shakiru Usman told this reporter that the early rain did not fall enough in the area to send farmers to the farms.<br /><br />“You cannot compare us with Dandume and Sabuwa where some farmers have started planting already because they had a heavy rainfall. Farmers here are ever ready, what only stopped us for now is the inadequate rain because even if you plant now, the crop would not germinate,” he said.<br /><br />He also forecast that many farmers will go for maize and rice, then soybeans and sorghum would follow in preference.<br /><br />Reports from Kwara, Niger, Oyo, Ekiti and Ogun states indicate that there has been early rainfall and farmers in the areas have planted maize, melon, groundnuts and yam.<br /><br />In Oyo, Ekiti and Ogun states, maize and melon were said to have germinated and growing.<br /><br />Farmers in the states hope for bumper harvest if the rain did not cease early.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an Associate Professor of Plant Breeding and Seed Science, Dr. Lucky Omoigui, of the Federal University of Agriculture (FUAM) Makurdi has advised grain farmers to wait a little more before planting their seeds.<br /><br />Omoigui posited that the coming of the rain in May, especially in the north, is not late for grain farmers and advised that they would need to allow the rainfall to stabilise by the middle of the month before they begin planting their crops.<br /><br /><b>By Hope Abah, Makurdi &amp; Idris Mahmud, Katsina&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Some unscrupulous fish farmers are using additives and fertilisers as feeds to boost catfish production in Nigeria, a fish farmer, Mr Phillip Ogunnaike, has revealed. Ogunnaike made the revelation in an interview in Lagos on Wednesday.<br /><br />Catfish He warned that the use of the chemicals might pose serious danger to Nigerians because of the popularity of catfish in eateries nationwide, especially in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, Calabar, Kaduna, Warri, Uyo and other cities.<br /><br />He noted that although there were some benefits of using fertilisers in fish farming, it was dangerous to use chemical-based feeds to produce fish for consumption. “The use of fertilisers to enhance the production of catfish will definitely yield better returns for local farmers.<br /><br />“But the kind of fertilisers some local farmers apply to fertilise the catfish is not healthy for consumers.<br /><br />According to him, some farmers use chemicals to boost the growth and production rate of catfish, to increase yield. Ogunnaike advised fish farmers to allow the farming process to take its natural course in fish production, rather than resorting to additives to make fast money.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UXHIkhrv_O0/WdcyqcR6OkI/AAAAAAAAAQU/OrzlH2qZQZIdh9Afa4A5aDTUJamCmToewCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/FISH-FARMING%2B-%2BCopy.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"194\" data-original-width=\"259\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UXHIkhrv_O0/WdcyqcR6OkI/AAAAAAAAAQU/OrzlH2qZQZIdh9Afa4A5aDTUJamCmToewCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/FISH-FARMING%2B-%2BCopy.jpg\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;“These chemically enhanced feeds are actually harmful to the catfish and ultimately to human consumption. He, however, attributed the rise in the practice and use of chemicals to boost the production of fish to the high demand of catfish in Nigeria.<br /><br />“The growing demand for catfish has generally necessitated the wrong use of chemical fertilisers to boost production by local farmers. Ogunnaike cited a farm at Ikorodu, near Lagos, where he said that the farm operators were always harvesting catfish at short intervals and selling at low prices to consumers.<br /><br />“Where 1Kg of catfish sells for between N600 to N900 per kg, they sell at N450 per Kg. This is quite questionable.”<br /><br />&nbsp;The farmer reiterated the need for the harvesting of the catfish to be done at the right time and for farmers to desist from cutting corners in their bid to make quick cash.<br /><br />“It takes between three to six months to harvest a healthy catfish, depending on the size you want and the quality of the feed.<br /><br />“If you feed the catfish very well on protein-based diet it will grow well.” He advised fish farmers to embrace the use of safe and healthy fertilisers that would in turn boost the production rate of their catfish.<br /><br />“There are some protein-based chemicals and fertilisers that can be applied to boost catfish production. “They contain elements like maggot and worms. They can be used as fertiliser for the fish. “Cow dung can also boost production of catfish but the quality of the animal dung....<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "With proper Agricultural Management, no state in Nigeria should be poor —Babalola",
    "content": "<br />Femi Babalola, popularly known as Jogor, is a businessman, an entrepreneur of repute, a politician and a farmer. In this interview with NURUDEEN ALIMI, he speaks on issues relating to agriculture in Oyo State and Nigeria in general.<br /><br /><b>As an engineer and a practicing farmer, how insperable are agriculture and engineering?</b><br /><br />The backbone of agriculture is engineering. When you talk of mechanisation, processing, preservation, transportation even when you talk about irrigation, all these things are engineering processes. Therefore, I do not see a way you could separate engineering from agriculture, they are inseparable, they are two good friends. As a matter of fact, I will say they are brother and sister that were born at the same time. They are twins.<br /><br /><b>Talking about Oyo State which is one of the biggest states in Nigeria with arable land, being an indigene of the state, do you think the state is really exploring its potentials in agriculture?</b><br /><br />No, we are not, we are not even scratching the ground when it comes to the potentials agriculture provides for this state. The land is fertile, the vegetation is right, the climate is wonderful but the government is confused. They do not know how to promote agriculture. Probably because of the fact that a lot of them have never had anything to do with agrculture and one thing I always say is that being a practitioner is different from someone that is advised to do something. So they probably do not know the problems agriculture portends and they do not know the potentials agriculture has in Oyo State. And when you talk about land, it is not going to be land in isolation, Like you asked in your first question, we have the manpower, we have the technology and the technical know-how, we have the engineering base here in Oyo State, we have rivers and streams crossing the whole of Oyo State. So, that is telling me that I can plant round the year when I have rivers and streams crisscrossing the whole state. In all the seven zones of Oyo State, there are rivers and streams, so there is nothing I cannot plant. About two months ago, I ate corn for the first time this year from farmers that plant maize by the riverside, so why can’t the state take advantage of that and plant maize along the length of the river Ogun and other so many rivers in the state? We are not just getting it right, agriculture alone can provide all the resources we need.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tFTIP9ZNF6c/WvGh-HU4ZaI/AAAAAAAABj0/EH61rMqDPbcD_T5W3bqb3b0NFnyEgqhugCLcBGAs/s1600/Jogor.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tFTIP9ZNF6c/WvGh-HU4ZaI/AAAAAAAABj0/EH61rMqDPbcD_T5W3bqb3b0NFnyEgqhugCLcBGAs/s320/Jogor.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><b>You are aspiring for the governorship seat in Oyo State, do you really have a blueprint for the development of agriculture if you are elected?</b><br /><br />Yes, I do because I am a farmer myself, I have one of the biggest individual cocoa plantations in the state and I know the problem we are encountering, I know the challenges farmers are going through and I have proffered solutions to them in my blueprint to alleviate the problems of farmers and to help farmers make more resources from what they do and to help them with modern implements and the necessary things. At the same time, I am also conscious of the fact that we can not totally eradicate the small farmers because they have role to play. We could form them into cooperatives. The blueprint also contains how to go about successive farming, which means that the farming does not just come to an end due to your demise or by the fact that you are no longer interested. There should be somebody to take over the farming so that the farm will not become bushy. My blueprint also contains processing of these farm produce, logistics, purchasing of the farm produce. Where will the market come from? How am I going to help the farmers cultivating presently and not expecting any income until six months time, How am I going to help him meet up his basic monetary needs? These are the things in my blueprint. The farmers will smile just like others in any other sector of the economy.<br /><br /><b>It has been your opinion that no state in Nigeria, particularly Oyo State, should be poor due to the opportunities that are abound in agriculture. Can you please dwell more on this?</b><br /><br />I have always been making reference to agriculture, agricultural programmes and revolution irrespectivre of oil money. Agriculture does not need big money, do you know a kongo of maize is less than a thousand naira? Do you know how much I can get from that? Do you know if I put a tractor on the farm and plough it do you know how much I am going pay? So you do not need so much to do agriculture, what you need is sincerity and dedication.<br /><br /><b>So, what you are saying now is that if Oyo State government is sincere and committed to agriculture, the economy of the state is going to be buoyant?</b><br /><br />Sincere and know. You see they are two different things, you may be sincere and lack knowledge. So your sincerity will be getting zero, you may have that sincerity but you may be doing a wrong thing. You must have a deep knowledge of what you are doing, So what we are saying is that sincerity of that knowledge gives you results. Maybe they are sincere but they are doing it the wrong way or maybe they are doing it right but not sincere otherwise…. I know the result I am getting from my farm which is just five years old. So I can imagine if government wants to do that on a larger scale. Farmers need to be encouraged, I just told you one of the greatest challenges of farmers in Nigeria, a lot of people are interested in farming but between the time I put my seed in the the soil and the time it is of market value on the farm, what happens to my everyday activities? How do I feed my family? How do I live? Because if I plant maize today for instance, It is going to take me three months before I can make a dime from it. Between the 0-3 months how do I feed my family? So there is that gap that is discouraging farmers. The farmer will leave the farm and go and hustle outside to look for income and by the time he comes back, cattle have eaten up the farm.<br /><br /><b>The problem with our agriculture seems to be the fact that it is discussed in isolation of the vast value chain, What do you see to this?</b><br /><br />I agree with you. You remember I mentioned processing, value chain, logistics and all that. You see, in other climes of the world it is even the end users that will drive the farm. It is the Nestle of this world that will be running after cocoa farmers so they are ready to give them all the inputs they need because they are waiting for their products to produce. They know that if the farmers do not produce, their machines will not work, their factory will close down. The British American Tobacco Company has a good template. BAT is like literarilly planting tobacco for the farmers, sending their children to school because they know that this is our life wire if anything happens to them then we do not have any business with those machines. So what I am saying is processing is key to planting, once you get the processing right, It is the end users that will be driving the farmers, They will be the ones encouraging them.<br /><br /><b>Talking about cocoa and maize, Do you really think we have end users that can drive the process on the farms?</b><br /><br />We may have the right end users but they may not be at the right place, the discussions may not be right. If you have an end user for example may be too far away from where you are producing it may affect them. All the tobacco farmers are around Iseyin, Oyo North up to Kwara State.And those are where the tobacco industries are: Ibadan and Ilorin so they are monitoring and do not forget that they have to consider their own cost of production as well. So if we are talking about maize, the poultry farmers that depend on them should be driving them.<br /><br /><b>As a politician do you think there should be a policy by government to address this lopsidedness?</b><br /><br />Yes. You see I belong to this school of thought that development should be policy-driven. Yes there could be free market but inside that free market, there should be some control, there should be some forces that will direct the position and direction of growth in such a way that will affect the whole populace. If you do not do it, there will not be any development. If development is lopsided, it affects the general well-being of the people of the country. That is exactly what is happening in Nigeria, the North-East is poor and now they are not allowing all of us to rest. Whether you like it or not it is affecting what I produce in the south here. Because part of what I produce is supposed to be consumed by them and if they are fighting I can not push things there. The person manufacturing plastic chairs cannot push his chairs there, so it is affecting us. So policies should be tinkered with. Like it is done in the banking industry and some other sectors like the aviation industry for example you will discover that some particular flights could only generate from a particular airport in the same country. It is intentional because they want to develop their country. In Europe for instance, there are some flights that could only originate from city airports. There are flights that will only originate from Manchester airport, if you say you are going to a particular country, they will tell you that you have to go to Manchester. Policies should be tinkered with, you cannot leave everything to free market because if you do that it is only the capitalists that will enjoy it but the world is not only for the capitalists or who takes care of the vulnerable? The vulnerable have to be removed from that class to the middle class. So if I do not help them, how would they move to the middle class? How would they add to the GDP of the nation? Otherwise people will be perpetually poor. There is this thing I always say, the rich must subsidise the poor.<br /><br /><b>By Nurudeen Alimi</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Food Prices held steady in April —FAO Report",
    "content": "<br />The FAO Food Price Index remained broadly steady in April, averaging 173.5 points for the month, a tiny notch up from March and 2.7 percent higher than in the same month of 2017.<br /><br />Prices of cereals and dairy products continued their recent rising trend, while those of sugar continued their decline.<br /><br />FAO also released its first forecasts for the 2018/19 marketing season, predicting a decline in global cereal output and reserves, both of which have been at or near record highs.<br /><br />Early prospects for global cereal markets in the year ahead are favourable, despite a forecasted decline, according to FAO’s new Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today.<br /><br />Global cereal crops output in 2018 is expected to fall to 2 607 million tonnes, about 1.6 percent below the near-record harvest of 2017.<br /><br />The decline is mostly due to an anticipated contraction in maize production, especially in the United States of America. Lower wheat output is mostly associated with an expected decline in the Russian Federation after an exceptional outcome the year earlier.<br /><br />Meanwhile, FAO tentatively forecasts world rice production to increase by 1.3 percent to reach 510.6 million tonnes, setting a new record high, due primarily to expanded cultivations in Asia.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mW2JHWslYl8/WvGhAlX2TMI/AAAAAAAABjs/bJyvq8czXiwnyi6X9SUyHl0ebO90OrwygCLcBGAs/s1600/Food%2BStuffs.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mW2JHWslYl8/WvGhAlX2TMI/AAAAAAAABjs/bJyvq8czXiwnyi6X9SUyHl0ebO90OrwygCLcBGAs/s320/Food%2BStuffs.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />As for cereal utilization, FAO’s new forecast – both food and feed – also points to an all-time high of 2 626 million tonnes.<br /><br />That reflects a projected 1.0 percent increase in world rice utilization, a 0.8 percent expansion in global wheat utilization and a 0.4 percent rise in total utilization of coarse grains, of which maize feed use is expected to increase by as much as 2.8 percent to a new high of 615 million tonnes.<br /><br />The largest year-on-year increase in the feed use of maize is envisaged in China and South America.<br /><br />As a result, FAO expects world cereal stocks at the close of seasons ending in 2019 to decline by 2.7 percent and the world cereal stocks-to-use ratio to drop to 27.2 percent, down from its 16-year high level of 28.8 percent in 2017/18 but well above the historical low of 20.4 percent registered in 2007/08.<br /><br />FAO’s first forecast of international trade in cereals in the year ahead is pegged at 406 million tonnes, implying a mere 0.6 percent decline from the all-time high anticipated for the current season.<br /><br />The FAO Cereal Price Index rose 1.7 percent in April, its fourth consecutive monthly increase, and is now 15.4 percent above its value a year earlier.<br /><br />Wheat prices were supported by weather-related risks in the United States, while drought-reduced production in Argentina and lower plantings in the U.S. pushed up international maize prices. Rice prices also rose.<br /><br />The FAO Dairy Price Index rose 3.4 percent from March, reflecting robust demand for all milk products and apprehensions about export availabilities in New Zealand.<br /><br />The FAO Food Price Index is a measure of the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities.<br /><br />Declines were posted in April on the three other sub-indices. The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index declined by 1.4 percent since March, while the FAO Meat Price Index fell 0.9 percent.<br /><br />The FAO Sugar Price Index fell 4.8 percent in April from the previous month, continuing a decline that began last December, and averaging 24 percent lower than April 2017.<br /><br />Lower prices reflected a supply glut buoyed by record outputs in Thailand and in India, the world’s second-largest sugar producer, as well as the depreciation of the Real, the currency of Brazil, the world’s largest producer.<br /><br /><b>By Collins Nnabuife</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

This represents a 110 percent increase from the ₦0.70 dividend paid in 2016.<br /><br />“Salt earnings remain a key driver of revenue. Revenue from salt comprised 81 percent or ₦22.2 billion of the ₦27 billion, largely unchanged from the proportion of revenues it generated in 2016 while seasoning generated two percent of the revenues.<br /><br />“NASCON also improved revenue across its geographical locations. Revenue from the eastern part of the country increased from ₦1.1 billion to ₦2.2 billion, the west also moved from ₦5 billion to ₦5.6 billion while the northern part of the country showed the biggest improvement as it jumped from ₦12 billion to ₦19 billion.”<br /><br />The shareholders, who approved a dividend of N1.50 kobo per share at the meeting, also commended the board and management of the company for posting good results in the full year ended December 31, 2017.<br /><br />Specifically, the Chairman, Trust Shareholders Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Muktar Muktar commended the company’s performance and appreciated the board and management who worked tirelessly to ensure that shareholders are rewarded with dividends.<br /><br />According to him, a total revenue increase of 48 percent in the year under review is a great feat given that many companies recorded losses as the domestic economy gradually recovers from recession.He added that the firm adopted global best practices in maintaining strategic reserves, which shows that the management cares about the future growth and expansion of the company.Another shareholder, John Evitar in his remarks commended the board and management on the improved performance especially in consistent payment of dividends.<br /><br /><b>By Helen Oji</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

It is a significant step and part of our strategy as a risk management company working with key value chain players to develop and ensure the adoption of sustainable productivity enhancing technology and practices for smallholder farmers. This will include a wide range of support such as improving seed yields, teaching best farm practices, and providing effective capacity building to farmers and other stakeholders, to ensure optimal productivity. The productivity enhancing technology and practices for smallholder farmers have been tested, validated and adopted across the globe and in African countries like South Africa, Kenya and Morocco. In Latin American countries such as Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. It is a success while in European countries of France, Italy, Spain and the UK; it is doing well, as well as USA and Canada. Farmers under CBN’s Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) as well as other primary production activities will enjoy this yield enhancing technology through our project monitoring, reporting and remediation offices across the 36 states plus the FCT. This presents the opportunity to reach over a million smallholder farmers leveraging on NIRSAL’s coverage and collaborations with critical stakeholders in the agricultural value chain. As an organisation, we are passionate about our mandate of rejuvenating agriculture and agribusiness in Nigeria, and are particularly appreciative of our strategic role in the implementation of the agricultural component of the Federal Government’s Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP) and the Agricultural Promotion Policy.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UZZL8llMS6s/WgW5IBvyqoI/AAAAAAAAAsw/IUixi6XR4F0ssEo2vFr3g_ptSQBKUkjFACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/MD%2BNIRSAL.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"442\" data-original-width=\"762\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UZZL8llMS6s/WgW5IBvyqoI/AAAAAAAAAsw/IUixi6XR4F0ssEo2vFr3g_ptSQBKUkjFACPcBGAYYCw/s320/MD%2BNIRSAL.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>For us at NIRSAL, the establishment of this partnership with Syngenta is a clear indication of the growing confidence of stakeholders – both public and private – in the Agricultural Policy and Economic Diversification agenda of the current administration.<br /><br />Syngenta was formed in 2000 following the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.

As such, our partnership with several stakeholders is a critical component of NIRSAL’s value-chain-fixing mandate as this would ensure the availability and use of quality inputs and the transfer of the knowledge required for enhanced crop production successes. For instance, we signed MoU with AGCO, a renowned manufacturer of tractors and related agricultural machineries; MECA for tractor refurbishment and finance;&nbsp; RIELA, for post-harvest technology solution; ACDI-VOCA for developing all-year round farming leveraging on irrigation; UNDP-NASDP towards eliminating supply chain bottlenecks, linking primary production to markets and technical assistance; MAMDA for enhancing local capacity in developing innovative insurance products; and several financial institutions (developmental and commercial) particularly the DBN, NEXIM, Union Bank, Stanbic IBTC, for provision of affordable and sustainable finance. The logic behind these collaborations is to crowd in key players in their respective value chain activities and support agricultural projects through technology transfer, training, offering discounted prices on products and services using NIRSAL as the fulcrum.<br /><br />Our approach in NIRSAL is to look at agriculture from an end to end value chain perspective, that is, from primary production activities like land clearing, input supply, mechanisation services, irrigation, harvesting, among others; to storage; processing (using conventional/alternative energy sources) and an eventual linkage to markets (consumer, industrial and exports) and thus tailor our initiatives and interventions as such.<br /><br /><b>Mandate</b><br /><br />NIRSAL is a risk-sharing system created by CBN with a mandate to enhance the flow of affordable finance and investments into fixed agricultural value chains. Our farmers need simple and reliable ways to maximise their yields. The thrust is to take a holistic approach and create integrated, tailored solutions. All these combined with advanced crop protection science, quality seeds delivering higher yields, and agronomic advice based on our deep insights into how smallholder farmers work can increase farmers’ yield by over 40-80 per cent.<br /><br /><b>Challenges</b><br /><br />Agriculture may have challenging moments but through proper planning, adoption of good agronomical practices and use of technology, it can certainly make a lot of difference in our farmers’ yield.<br /><br /><b>NASDP</b><br /><br />The Nigerian Agribusiness Supplier Development Project (NASDP) focuses on eliminating supply chain bottlenecks in the rice and cassava value chains through improved linkage between production and processing actors. As you’re aware, our primary mandate is to fix the broken agricultural value chain thereby facilitating the flow of finance and investment to the agricultural sector. One way we approach this is by sharing risks with agricultural value chain players particularly providers of finance by providing credit risk guarantees on viable agricultural projects and supporting agricultural value chain players with technical assistance, innovative projects and several other catalytic initiatives.<br /><br />The current drive of the Federal Government has brought agricultural development to the fore, with major focus on rice and cassava in this case. NASDP will be a critical vehicle to support the development of these two commodities. The NASDP programme is embedded in UNDP’s Regional Bureau Programme for Africa and is in tandem with the current administration’s Agriculture Promotion Policy (APP).<br /><br />Consequently, UNDP, in conjunction with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and NIRSAL, will implement key objectives under this projects. These include improving the supply of agricultural products by farmers particularly in the rice and cassava value chains and MSME’s with timely deliveries, reduce transportation and inventory costs and improve access to growing markets provided by structured&nbsp; off-takers; secure and provide off-takers, efficient and high-quality local agricultural raw materials; contribute to the development of African economies through increased job creation, Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and enhanced government income through taxation by developing agricultural products that can substitute imports and create access to export market; and finally, to support the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially food security and poverty reduction, through job creation and income generation.<br /><br />The target beneficiary groups include smallholder farmers and women, while the target market will include off-takers and agro-dealers who provide inputs into the agricultural value chains. This will enhance the prospect for increased farmer yields and quality.<br /><br />Being a national programme, implementation will focus on areas of comparative advantage for rice and cassava. Where we have critical mass of these commodity value chain players, this will generate expected impact by creating socio-economic benefits to smallholder farmers in rural communities. It should also create an efficient supply chain logistic that will impact operations of large corporates (processors), hence, generating massive employment for the Nigerian population.<br /><br />This project will promote Public Private Partnership (PPP)on these selected value chains, facilitate technology and knowledge transfer and stimulate the set-up of commodity processing hubs. NIRSAL places emphasis on PPP as this will ensure the sustainability and affordability of projects along the agricultural value chain. Under the terms of the collaboration, NIRSAL will be contributing a total of $1,558,500, approximately 20 per cent of the entire funding requirement of $8,066,500 to implement the project. Out of NIRSAL’s contribution, the sum of $558,500 will be utilised under NIRSAL’s Technical Assistance Pillar for capacity building of the beneficiaries, while $1,000,000 is non-expendable credit that can be applied under the CBN ABP and other financing interventions.<br /><br />The UNDP’s intention under this project is to promote economic growth through local capacity building and robust PPP to generate opportunities for income generation. The aim is to ultimately support gender responsive and inclusive policies that will stimulate and expand domestic and foreign trade for global competitiveness.<br /><br />The NASDP will thus focus on women empowerment and youth in Agribusiness through support to women’s cooperatives and youth enterprises. The Inclusive Business Acceleration Model will also be deployed toward these groups. It is important to emphasise that the Inclusive business model will aim at providing quality basic products and services within the low-income communities.<br /><br />This will harness endogenous resources and opportunities for value addition. It will also build local capacities for managing harvest seasons with a long-term view of achieving sustained growth of commodity markets and price stabilisation.<br /><br /><b>By: Uche Usim,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Executive Director, Development Concern of Panacea for Development and Infrastructural Challenges for Africa Initiative, Mr. Martins Egot, has lamented the continued loss of economic trees to deforestation.<br /><br />Specifically, he said economic trees planted on 23,911 hectares of land were destroyed from 2007 to 2014 in Cross River State as a result of deforestation.<br /><br />He spoke on Friday in an interview with our correspondent on the sidelines of a two-day sensitisation workshop for high-level state forest directors and local government authorities and civil society groups to create awareness on national forest inventory held in Lafia, Nasarawa State.<br /><br />He expressed worry over the huge loss of economic trees to deforestation in the country.<br /><br />Egot also lamented the forest loss, noting that between 2000 and 2007, forest spanning 77,148 hectares of land was lost as the land was used for planting of crops.<br /><br />“These figures are a compound aggregate for both subsistence and commercial agricultural activities and no attribution was provided to that effect.”<br /><br />The Country Representative, Food Agriculture Organisation, Mr. Suffyan Koroma, however, said the organisation would commence the field data collection for forest inventory, aimed at tackling deforestation and other environmental problems across the country.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KW3UolZJjgY/Wia1XQrUZCI/AAAAAAAAA68/OaT8WUwxqhMgfLtNbQLH5MOD70xRCPLtQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Forest.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KW3UolZJjgY/Wia1XQrUZCI/AAAAAAAAA68/OaT8WUwxqhMgfLtNbQLH5MOD70xRCPLtQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Forest.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />According to him, the field data collection for forest inventory is imperative for estimating forest bio-gas and carbon stocks, adding that the exercise would provide a good understanding on how best the forest resources would be used.<br /><br />Koroma, who was represented by the Forestry Officer, FAO, Mr. John Fonweban, said, “The inventory will be a ‘low-intensity’ one that intends to sample all forest and land use types in the country so as to estimate emission factors for the establishment of the Forest Reference Emission Level for Nigeria.”<br /><br />He explained that FREL would serve as a benchmark or standard on which future REDD+activities would be measured during the implementation of the REDD+ strategy for Nigeria.<br /><br />He said, “It is an inventory that covers all the land use types in the sense that you have one hectare of forest destroyed and used for agric plantation you will be able to see how much you are losing. So it goes with the assessment for remote sensing to calculate the emissions and that is why the forest reference has to be done to get the historical changes and emissions that have been taking place in Nigeria as business as usual without any project.<br /><br />“We have to establish that reference level otherwise you won’t be able to assess the performance of Nigeria in terms of mitigation within the Paris Agreement.”<br /><br />He added, “It is to sample ecological zones in Nigeria with the intention of estimating forest biomas for the different ecological zones. This is very important because Nigeria is working towards a forest reference level.”<br /><br /><b>By: Umar Muhammed,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Ginger Farmers Foresee in Production",
    "content": "<br /><br />Ginger farmers in Kaduna State&nbsp; are lamenting bitterly over what they said is a calculated attempt by marketers to milk them dry.<br /><br />&nbsp;They said while ginger is doing well at the international market, the price at home this year is about 55% lower than what obtained last year.<br /><br />&nbsp;Some of the farmers who spoke with this reporter in Kaduna, last week, said they were unable to sell what they have in stock and that will affect this year’s production.<br /><br />&nbsp;Monday Adukwa, secretary of the Ginger Farmers Association in Kagarko Local Government Area of the state, has been in ginger production for over 35 years.<br /><br />&nbsp;He told Daily Trust that the challenges they have with ginger farming mainly have to do with the market.<br /><br />&nbsp;“We produce but when it comes to market, somebody (referring to marketers) out there decides the price for us. As I am talking to you, the price of ginger in the international market is between N55,000 and N65,000 per bag.” But when it comes to local market, the marketers buy at not more than N7,000 at the moment.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4g_S9Ki_D98/Wur54QmZFQI/AAAAAAAABhk/UAiGPqLSDUIW7B4Hr51VGgF1BxGasOR7ACLcBGAs/s1600/Ginger.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"363\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4g_S9Ki_D98/Wur54QmZFQI/AAAAAAAABhk/UAiGPqLSDUIW7B4Hr51VGgF1BxGasOR7ACLcBGAs/s320/Ginger.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Right from the beginning of the year, the price of ginger crashed to between N3,000 and N5,000,” he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;Mr Adukwa noted that the price of ginger last year and this year was incomparable. He said last year, ginger was sold between N15,000 and N19,000 per bag, while this year the price has literally collapsed.<br /><br />&nbsp;This he stressed, has affected him negatively because he was unable to even pay his children’s school fees.<br /><br />&nbsp;The 47-year-old father of four said three of the children are in higher institutions and one in secondary school, adding that through ginger farming, he generates the income to pay their fees.<br /><br />&nbsp;At the moment, he has over 100 bags of ginger yet to be sold.<br /><br />&nbsp;Bala Illiya, a 38-year old graduate of accounting was emotional while responding to questions from this reporter. He stressed that he took to ginger farming full time four years ago but the erratic price reminds him of the problem with the nation’s weak agric policies.<br /><br />&nbsp;For him, the sharp drop in price was a conspiracy by marketers to thwart the efforts of farmers particularly in southern Kaduna – a claim Daily Trust cannot independently confirm.<br /><br />&nbsp;These marketers, he said, were not farmers but decide what price ginger should be sold at, adding “we are helpless.”<br /><br />&nbsp;“Go to our areas there is ginger everywhere because the price is too low for us to sell. If you sell at this current price, you are doomed. Thank God ginger is not something that spoils easly,” he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;Two farmers who wouldn’t want their names mentioned said the Kaduna State Government supported most crops but did not consider promoting ginger to attract investment.<br /><br />They argued that it was a deliberate attempt. One of the farmers who is a graduate of Agric Engineering believed that ginger production is caught up in the politics of Southern and Northern Kaduna.<br /><br />The farmers also believed that lack of processing companies in the country, weak farmers’ associations and unorganized market system have affected ginger for many years.<br /><br />They said government could easily attract private sector participation adding that Nigerian ginger is a spice that is the best in the world and in huge demand.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, the falling market price at home is what the farmers do not understand and are seeking answers to.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

Other chilli producing countries includes India, Myanmar, Mexico, Peru, Vietnam, Pakistan, Ghana and Bangladesh. Kenya is now producing chillies at commercial level and their farmers are making millions from chillies production. It is high time Nigerian farmers started taking the advantages of producing chillies.<br /><br />People consumes chilli everyday not because of its spicy and aroma but due to its numerous health benefits. For instance, green chillies are an excellent source of many minerals and vitamins, especially of antioxidants so it can act as janitors in providing protection against damage from free radical and preventing many cancers.<br /><br />The Vitamin C content of green chillies is beneficial in strengthening immunity naturally to the diseases.<br /><br />Chillies also keep the prostate cancer away from the men and also helpful in reducing the high blood sugar level of the body and it release endorphins significantly into the brain and works are mood refresher among others.<br /><br />The Executive Director, GoGreen Africa Initiative, Ambassador Adeniyi Bunmi said that currently, commercial chilli farming is pretty successful and anyone can earn an excellent profit with instant income because there is always a great demand in the local and international market.<br /><br />According to him, beside growing on the commercial open field, people can also grown in poly houses, greenhouses, pots, containers, backyards, under shade nets, etc.<br /><br />He explained: “However, the quality and quantity of yield are higher, if grown under controlled environmental conditions like growing in greenhouses. With advanced chilli farming technology, it is also possible to grow them successfully in the hydroponic system.”<br /><br />Speaking on the varieties of chlli, he said presently, there are many improved varieties of chilli that are available in the market, and they often know differently depending on the area.&nbsp; He said some of the famous chilli varieties across the world are Kashmiri Chilli, Guntur Chilli, Bird’s Eye Chilli – Dhani, Naga Chilli, Mundu Chilli, Jwala Chilli, Kanthari Chilli, Byadagi Chilli, Green Cayenne, Red Cayenne, Yellow Cayenne, Red Ball, Green Ball, Birdseye, Jalapeno, Habanero.<br /><br />He noted that there might be another variety of chilli, which is popular in some people’s area in accordance with the climate conditions and atmosphere.<br /><br />Speaking on marketing, he said farmers could supply freshly harvested green chillies to the local market on the basis of market requirement.

If the farmers see they implement this technology and their growth is increasing two times and their profits will increasing in many folds. We started and Kenya and we very good there and the farmers over there very appreciated because a lot of investment that came into the country. There is prospect in growth and costs reduce.

    "content": "<br />The National Executive Council (NEC) yesterday approved the recommendation of its sub-committee that open grazing of cattle be banned across the country.<br /><br />The three-man sub-committee on herdsmen/farmers clashes constituted by the government in February 2018 was headed by the governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi.<br /><br />It was specifically mandated to unravel the causes of herdsmen/farmers clashes and dialogue with relevant stakeholders to end the killings of innocent citizens.<br /><br />Other members of the sub-committee included Governors Simon Lalong (Plateau), Samuel Ortom (Benue), Darius Ishaku (Taraba), and Bindo Jubrilla (Adamawa). The panel was mandated to visit Benue, Taraba, Zamfara and Adamawa states.<br /><br />Umahi told State House correspondents after the NEC meeting at the Presidential Villa presided over by Vice President Yemi Osinbajo yesterday, that the panel submitted its report to the council which okayed the recommendation to ban open grazing, opting for the establishment of ranches in states affected by the herdsmen onslaught.<br /><br />He said NEC blamed the incessant killings by herdsmen on perception and reports by the media.<br /><br />“The core causes of the conflicts, we were made to understand, were perception and of course our media friends, competition for scarce resources and banditry or what you can call pure criminal activities through cattle rustling and kidnapping‎.”<br /><br />Governor Umahi, who said his team visited five states Benue, Taraba, Plateau Adamawa and Zamfara, told newsmen that there were three main categories of herdsmen in Nigeria. These, according to him, are foreign herdsmen, nomadic herdsmen and migrant herdsmen whose continued activities have resulted in clashes with farmers.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7IKPoamMhBQ/WdcyfS3URPI/AAAAAAAAAQU/gyMNFMuaYHscMr-G0nyrTGkQr05CS5U4gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cattle%2BGrazing.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7IKPoamMhBQ/WdcyfS3URPI/AAAAAAAAAQU/gyMNFMuaYHscMr-G0nyrTGkQr05CS5U4gCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Cattle%2BGrazing.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said the NEC also agreed that the states affected by herdsmen killings donate land for the establishment of ranches that will include nomadic schools and health facilities for their family members.<br /><br />“Niger and Kaduna have given lands, and Plateau is also giving land. We also agreed that through the agriculture ministry, we have to introduce new species of cows.”<br /><br />Umahi said the council members accepted the recommendation to stop the further influx of foreign herdsmen into the country.<br /><br />Even in their hiding places, residents of Benue State are not safe as militia Fulani herdsmen yesterday invaded an unofficial internally displaced persons camp at the African Church in Mbamondo clan of Ukemberagya Gaambe-Tiev, Logo Local Government Area and murdered seven persons.<br /><br />The attack came less than 24 hours after the herdsmen attacked some villages in Guma and Gwer West local government areas, leaving no fewer than 43 villagers dead.<br /><br />The Guardian learnt that the herdsmen arrived in Mondo settlement about 12:22 a.m. and started shooting sporadically at the displaced persons who were asleep in the church and the primary school buildings on the church premises.<br /><br />His words: “Though seven bodies have been recovered so far, we are yet to ascertain the total number of casualties. The marauders, after they killed the people and sacked the entire village, proceeded to Zaki Biam/ Wukari road, mounted roadblocks and began to collect motorcycles and other valuables from travellers.<br /><br />“As I speak with you, they are still there, but we are yet to see or hear that security personnel have gone there.”<br /><br />The chairman of Logo LGA, Richard Nyajor, who confirmed the incident, said: “The casualties may be many, but so far, we have recovered about seven bodies and we are still searching for more. These killers have taken over our entire area, we are now leaving at the mercy of God.<br /><br />Efforts to get police confirmation of the incident failed as the Commissioner of Police, Fatai Owoseni and the command’s Public Relations Officer, Moses Yamu did not pick calls put through to them.<br /><br />The Chairman of the Nigeria Governors’ Forum (NGF), Abdulaziz Yari, said the governors had been working assiduously with the Federal Government to tackle the lingering security challenges across the country.<br /><br />Yari disclosed this to newsmen yesterday morning at the end of a closed-door meeting of the NGF held at its headquarters in Abuja.<br /><br />The NGF meeting, the third of its type this year, was convened to address critical issues facing the governors and their states in relation with the Federal Government.<br /><br />Yari described the security challenge facing the Nigeria as a global phenomenon, which governments all over the world are striving to subdue.<br /><br />Angered by the deteriorating security situation in Benue State, the House of Assembly has summoned Governor Samuel Ortom to brief the lawmakers on actions being taken by the state security council to end the killings.<br /><br />Ortom is to appear in plenary next Wednesday for the interface. The House also resolved to suspend plenary for one week in solidarity with the victims of the attacks.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the ravaged Tiv and the rampaging Fulani in Nasarawa State have agreed to end the killings in the southern senatorial zone. The agreement was signed by Joint Peace Committee of Tiv and Fulani yesterday in Lafia.<br /><br />The chairman of Miyetty Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN), Nasarawa chapter, while addressing the gathering said the meeting was aimed at bringing an end to the killings.<br /><br />Read More: Again, suspected herdsmen kill seven Tiv farmers in Nasarawa<br /><br />According to him, as the two groups have agreed to live in peace with each other in their communities, they do not need any security to enforce any peace.<br /><br />He warned the Fulani people in the state not to take the laws into their hands but report any provocative act to their leaders for onward action.<br /><br />Similarly, the President of Tiv Development Association (TDA) in the state, Boniface Ifer, said his kinsmen were willing to live in peace with the Fulani. He lamented that the Fulani were transferring aggression over the implementation of the anti-open grazing law in Benue State to them in Nasarawa.<br /><br />The event was attended by representatives of Tiv and Fulani leaders from Awe, Obi, Doma, Keana and Lafia local government areas.<br /><br />Also yesterday, the Primate of All Nigeria (Anglican Communion), Most Rev. Nicholas Okoh asked Nigerians to demand the fulfillment of their security contract with the Federal Government.<br /><br /><br />Describing the wanton killings as “terrible”, Okoh said it was disheartening that value was no longer placed on human life. He said the attitude of the government had compounded the situation.<br /><br />The cleric spoke to reporters at Amagu Nsude, Udi Local Government Area, Enugu State shortly after the dedication of the Bishop’s court complex and commissioning of Ejindu Microfinance Bank built by Enugu North Diocese of the Anglican Communion.<br /><br />Okoh lamented that the country’s insecurity had assumed a frightening dimension.<br /><br />“The security of the country is essentially the responsibility of the government because that is why they were voted to power. Voting is a part of the contract between the people and all those who were being governed and the essential element of that contract is security. So it is left for the people to know whether the contract is being kept or not.”<br /><br />He called on Nigerians to make good use of the ongoing voters’ registration to obtain their Permanent Voter’s Card (PVC), stressing that it was the only weapon that could help them determine their future.<br /><br /><b>By Lawrence Njoku (Enugu), Terhemba Daka, Mathew Ogunne (Abuja), Joseph Wantu (Makurdi) and Abel Abegonye (Lafia)</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why Shortage of Tomato Persists in Rainy Season",
    "content": "<br /><b>How farmers can turn the tide, by experts</b><br />Over the years, tomato production in Nigeria is largely done through irrigation in most states of the north. Only a few could afford to grow the widely consumed fruit in green houses during the rain-fed season.<br /><br />&nbsp;Kadawa irrigation valley in Kano State is home to the largest number of dry season producers. An appreciable number of the producers could also be found in Katsina, Kaduna, Sokoto, Jigawa and Plateau states, with pockets spread across other states.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, many of these farmers do not have the facilities (like green houses or rain-fed varieties) to produce during the wet season as the local varieties are not suitable for rain-fed. This inexorably creates scarcity during the rainy (wet) season.<br /><br />&nbsp;The dry season favours the local varieties because the nights are cooler as a result of lower mist in the air whereas growing the fruit in the wet season becomes difficult because heat is trapped in the moisture and the soil temperature is high making the varieties that farmers have difficult to cultivate.<br /><br />&nbsp;Mira Mehta, the CEO of Tomato Jos Farming &amp; Processing, a company currently involved in the production of tomato along Kangima Dam in Kaduna, who spoke with one of our reporters recently, said the company could not produce during the rain-fed season because of the cost involved.<br /><br />&nbsp;Although the company uses a variety called E8400 from a US company called BHN, which is high-yielding, it is alsothat too is not suitable for the wet season; therefore for Mehta, their 500-hectare land will be used for maize during the wet season.<br /><br />&nbsp;However, the introduction of heat-tolerant varieties and their availability, which is a significant development in the tomato industry, may change the story of perennial scarcity of the fruit/berry during the rainy season.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

four bags of NPK 15-15-15 fertiliser should be applied while two bags of Urea 46% Nitrogen fertiliser should be applied at six weeks after transplanting.<br /><br />He explained that in order to effectively manage pest and disease attacks, insecticides and fungicides application should start six weeks after transplanting, that is at the onset of flowering and should be done biweekly.<br /><br />Some of the chemicals Dr Shero recommended include Cypermethrin and demethioete, Tihan (broad-spectrum) and Confidor.<br /><br />The expert however observed that pest and disease control could start earlier depending on observation by the farmer.<br /><br />Another expert, Bashir Ahmad-Babaji, a Professor of Horticulture at the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) ABU, called for research on heat-tolerant tomato varieties, to lessen tomato scarcity in the country during the wet season.<br /><br />&nbsp;The professor, who spoke to the News Agency of Nigeria in Kaduna, noted that more research will address the shortages.<br /><br /><b>All-year-round farming means more money for farmers</b><br /><br />If these heat-tolerant varieties are upscaled in the country, that will create more opportunities for farmers to make more money all-year-round.<br /><br />At the beginning of every wet season, Nigeria experiences shortage of tomato because production is mostly in the dry season.<br /><br />&nbsp;At the moment, even with the advancing rainy season, disease is already threatening the availability of the produce in the market; and this will further heighten fear as the Ramadan fasting period&nbsp; approaches. This however means more money for farmers in states like Borno, Sokoto, Yobe, Kebbi and some other northern states where rainfall will take more weeks before it sets in. More production can still be done in these states unlike other states where the rain has started, which traditionally halts tomato production.<br /><br />At present, the price of the commodity has started rising. In Kebbi State for example, a sizable basket of tomato that sold for less the N2,500 some weeks ago has risen to about N6,500.<br /><br />Sahabi Bunza, one of the farmers, who spoke to our correspondent on why tomato is scarce in the state even before the commencement of the rainy season, observed that only few farmers in the state were into tomato farming. “I think what is responsible for the scarcity and increase in tomato price is the shortage in its supply. We don’t farm tomato in large quantity in Kebbi State,” he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;The price of tomato has also gone up in Katsina State and a cross-section of residents of the state who spoke with one of our reporters expressed fear that the situation would be compounded as the annual Ramadan fasting would soon commence.<br /><br />A resident of Funtua, Umar Sani, said that demand for the produce also increases during the fasting and Sallah periods because people prefer variety of dishes and as well cook in large quantities&nbsp; for the less privileged.<br /><br />An irrigation farmer, Alhaji Isiya Danja, said unbearable hot climate, pest attacks and drying up of water sources were the main reasons for fresh tomato shortage from end of March to early July.<br />&nbsp;But an irrigation expert, Alhaji Adamu Funtua, did not entirely agree with this claim, saying many farmers in Katsina were either scared of cultivating tomato during the rainy season or preferred to farm cereal crops.<br /><br />“Many of the farmers lack potential on the basic steps to cultivate tomato during the rainy season. They always attribute their failure to the acidity of the rain water not knowing that the choice of the tomato seed variety is sacrosanct,” he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;In Sokoto State, the price of tomato has risen from N5,000 to N7,000 per basket in recent weeks.<br />The state deputy chairman, Tomatoes Sellers Association, Alhaji Shehu Mani, told one of our reporters that before the rainy season, supply of tomatoes dropped and prices are higher because of the scarcity.<br /><br />“Last two weeks, the harvested tomatoes was sold at N4,000 to N5,000 per basket while damaged ones went for N2,500–N3,000 but now it is being sold at between N5,000 and N7,000 while damaged ones are sold for N3,000 to N4,000,” he disclosed,<br /><br />Mani explained: “During the hot season, the price continues to rise because the supply is not much. It could be sold at N6,000 today but tomorrow, the price could jump to N7,000 –N8,000.”<br />He said when it becomes very difficult to grow tomatoes in Sokoto, Kebbi and Zamfara, they go to Niger Republic for the produce.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Getting Quality Seeds for 2018 Rain-fed Farming",
    "content": "<br /><br />One of the challenges confronting Nigerian farmers is access to quality seeds, which is key to good yield.<br /><br />At the moment, most Nigerian farmers use grains instead of certified seeds from reputable producers. This has kept the average yield in most of the crops below the global average.<br /><br />However, that is about to change as some seed producers said they have stretched their reach to cover more farmers in the 2018 farming season.<br /><br />Dr Mahavir Singh, Head, Seed Division, WACOT Ltd, Funtua, Katsina told Daily Trust in a mail last week that the company has taken further steps to reach more farmers in 2018 compared to the 2017 season.<br /><br />&nbsp;He said: “Nigerian farmers are widely dispersed and distant from the towns and cities where accessibility of quality seed and reach by companies is difficult, so WACOT is supplying seed directly to farmers through an outgrowers programme. Last year WACOT supplied seeds to 25,000 farmers for maize, soybean, rice and sesame crops.<br /><br />“This year we are targeting more farmers and planning to distribute the certified WACOT seeds to 35,000 farmers directly.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3U_3wIrZc5Y/WuGo8VRusKI/AAAAAAAABfY/xAJxhRTO1x80F0d3XDD7Oc81-NYDapdggCLcBGAs/s1600/GM%2BMaize.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3U_3wIrZc5Y/WuGo8VRusKI/AAAAAAAABfY/xAJxhRTO1x80F0d3XDD7Oc81-NYDapdggCLcBGAs/s320/GM%2BMaize.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Dr Singh reiterated that WACOT’s objective was to provide farmers with good quality and certified seeds at affordable prices and close to their doorsteps.<br /><br />He also said that WACOT has over 1,500 agro dealers directly involved in seed sales across the country. “We understand the farmers’ needs and based on our marketing strategies they are met. We have high yielding varieties, nutritional, rich varieties (enriched with Provitamin A), drought tolerant and also resistant to virus and fungal disease,” he added.<br /><br />He noted that the company recommends and distributes seeds based on the agro climate to enable farmers get more benefits. Varieties such as drought tolerant and early maturing seeds are recommended for Sudan Savannah areas like Kano, Jigawa, and Sokoto. “At the same time we are recommending disease resistant and Striga weed tolerant varieties in the southern region,” he also said.<br /><br />&nbsp;On its part, Premier Seed Nigeria Limited, which started in 1994 and is involved in research, production and marketing of seeds of hybrid and open-pollinated maize, rice, sorghum, millet, soybean, cotton, cowpea, groundnut and assorted vegetables (exotic and local), said they are ready to supply quality seeds this wet season.<br /><br />Afolabi Samson Oluwaseun, Manager, Research &amp; Development Premier Seed Nigeria Limited, Zaria, Kaduna State, also told Daily Trust through a mail that they are prepared to reach more farmers this year.<br /><br />“In preparation for the incoming season of 2018, the company has produced about 18,000mt of certified seeds of various crop varieties for the wet season. They are currently available for sales and distribution in the incoming season (2018).<br /><br />“The seeds have been tested, processed, graded and well packaged in different sizes and ready for deployment across the different states in Nigeria. They are treated with potent crop protection chemicals such as insecticides and fungicides for healthy growth and development.<br /><br />“All our seeds are high yielding and resilient to several biotic and abiotic factors that constrain grain production,” he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;According to him, some of the products they have include drought tolerant, heat tolerant and Striga resistant maize varieties (Oba Super 11 and Oba Super 9); Pro-vitamin A maize varieties (Oba Super 6 and Sammaz 38), quality protein maize varieties (Oba 98) and other varieties with salient and desirable features (Oba Super 2, Oba Super 4 and Oba Super 3).<br /><br />&nbsp;Other crop varieties available are rice (both upland and lowland), sorghum, soybean, cowpea and assorted vegetables such as tomatoes, cucumber, watermelon and carrot. He said the seeds can be obtained from their zonal offices across 22 states of the country, from agro dealers and through their online marketing platform.<br /><br />In the last two years, the National Agricultural Seed Council has more than 176,140 MT of seed that have been certified for 134 companies in the country.<br /><br />&nbsp;Ironically, while the country’s farmers have limited access to certified seeds, Nigeria is said to be producing 75% of the seeds used in West Africa, according to the NASC Director-General, Dr Philip Ojo.<br /><br />&nbsp;The council, which regulates seeds companies, ensures that farmers get quality seeds for planting.<br /><br />&nbsp; Farmers can also take advantage of the research institutes close to them as most of them have good seeds but lack marketing networks that would bring them closer to the farmers.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "content": "<br />AFRICA needs to double her cassava production to avert a major food crisis by 2050, says the Director for the Global Cassava Partnership for the 21st Century (GCP21), Dr&nbsp; Claude Fauquet in Lagos.<br /><br />Addressing a world press conference in Lagos, Dr Fauquet described the low root yields of cassava in Africa as unacceptable and called on member nations to adequately invest in the crop to change the current yield per hectare.<br /><br />Though accounting for 55 percent of global cassava root production, Africa’s yield per hectare (ha) is the lowest in the world with about 10 tons per ha as opposed to Asia where average yield is 21 tonnes per ha, —or double the yield in Africa.<br /><br />Dr Fauquet, whose speech comes ahead of the fourth International Cassava Conference in Cotonou, Republic of Benin on June 11-15, 2018, said a do-nothing approach would hurt the continent as it would have to contend with more people to feed, and changes in climate that would become more unpredictable.<br /><br />He argued that to reverse the current trajectory would demand deliberate steps including greater investment in research and innovations, provisions of a favorable policy framework, accessibility of loans to farmers at single digit rates, and mechanization across the value chain.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

    "content": "<br />As the rain-fed season begins across some agro-ecological zones of the country, Daily Trust examines the preparations so far by stakeholders to make inputs - most importantly fertilizer and quality seeds - available to farmers.<br /><br />The chairman, Agro Dealers Association of Nigeria, the major input supplier, Alhaji Kabiru Fara, said they have enough fertiliser on ground to serve 10 million farmers for the wet season.<br /><br />Mr Fara, who spoke with Daily Trust on Monday, stressed that they operate at two levels: in the open market where they do their normal sales business and at the subsidy market where government determined the number of farmers to get inputs.<br /><br />On the first level, he said they have enough fertilizer under the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) for farmers, in which they are registered members to buy and sell<br /><br />He said: “The second level is that there is government programme called GES where government enlisted farmers nationwide to pay 50% of the cost and government gives us 50% later.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TZolCVz-H-M/Wth6482efAI/AAAAAAAABdA/T-D1nT76whw6xQuxle3MuBKcvBdx8wo5wCLcBGAs/s1600/Bags%2Bof%2BFertilizers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"433\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"209\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-TZolCVz-H-M/Wth6482efAI/AAAAAAAABdA/T-D1nT76whw6xQuxle3MuBKcvBdx8wo5wCLcBGAs/s320/Bags%2Bof%2BFertilizers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“For that, the preparation is still on and we are waiting to get the final notice from the Federal Government so that we can get ready for it because it involves distributing inputs to all 774 LGAs of the country. But for now we are operating our normal business in the open market.”<br /><br />Speaking on the number farmers that may benefit from this year’s&nbsp; Growth Enhancement Support (GES) scheme, he said government will decide on how many farmers it wants to cover.<br /><br />Last season, only 500,000 farmers were captured for the dry season as against 2.5 million farmers. Government may capture maybe five or ten million, he added.<br /><br />On seeds, Fara gave reason why improved seeds will be in short supply. He said government still owned seed companies which means many of them are unable to provide good seeds for the farmers, unless government subsidises it.<br /><br />“Seed producers need to be encouraged by the government,” he added.<br /><br />Chairman of the presidential fertilizer initiative Mr Thomas Etuh&nbsp; last week said PFI will produce one million tonnes of 20:10:10 NPK for the 2018 rain-fed season.<br /><br />Indorama Eleme Fertilizers &amp; Chemicals Limited, a major producer of Urea fertiliser in the country has confirmed its plan to increase Urea fertiliser supply for Nigerian farmers need - 750,000MT – for the forthcoming farming season.<br /><br />This is also in addition to the boost in the amount of Urea the company intends to supply to the Federal Government, from 180,000MT supplied last year to 360,000MT this year for the production of NPK (20:10:10) fertilisers.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "content": "<br />Garden egg is a popular vegetable/fruit consumed throughout the country either in its fresh form, cooked or fried depending on the cultural orientation of the consumer.<br /><br />The vegetable, otherwise known as eggplant, thrives in well drained soils rich in organic matter. It could be planted either directly or by raising them in nursery beds before transplanting on the main field.<br /><br />Growing eggplants is similar to growing peppers and tomatoes; they are heavy feeders and require constant supply of moisture.<br /><br />According to mofa.gov.gh, thorough land preparation is important in facilitating early crop establishment and adequate weed control, adding that 30 tonnes of organic matter/ farm yard manure should be incorporated per hectare at least a fortnight to planting.<br /><br />It has a planting seed rate of 350g to 500g per hectare. Seedlings should be transplanted to the main field at five leaf stage.<br /><br />It is worthy to note that transplanting is to be done preferably in the late afternoon.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sk2-_9j6Ju4/WthyVSW3GbI/AAAAAAAABck/pYJ2IHzFpFgkMjRXMZjMHsbFNGWoizHMwCLcBGAs/s1600/Garden%2BEgg.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sk2-_9j6Ju4/WthyVSW3GbI/AAAAAAAABck/pYJ2IHzFpFgkMjRXMZjMHsbFNGWoizHMwCLcBGAs/s320/Garden%2BEgg.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />mofa.gov.gh further advised that farmers use soil analysis as a guide for fertiliser application, giving a general recommendation of 2-3 split application of 250kg to 400kg/ha of 15-15-15 NPK fertiliser.<br /><br />Side dressing should be done at four, eight, 12 and 16 weeks after planting, with 5g of potassium nitrate added per plant after each harvest for optimum yield.<br /><br />Note that it will not set fruit when the temperature is too hot or too low, thus not suitable for greenhouse farming.<br /><br />On harvesting, garden egg starts fruiting about two months after transplanting and may continue fruiting for three months or more. Eggplants due for harvest should have shiny skin and attractive colour and should be done twice weekly.<br /><br />It is advisable to cut the eggplants with knife from the branches with about 5cm stalk and calyx attached.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Minister of Interior, Abdulrahman Dambazzau, on Wednesday disclosed that the Economic Community of West African States would hold a conference from April 26 to 29 on the incessant farmers/herdsmen clashes that have left many dead.<br /><br />He told State House correspondents that President Muhammadu Buhari would declare the conference open.<br /><br />The minister said the conference was part of efforts by the ECOWAS and some other African countries towards finding permanent solutions to the persistent farmers-herdsmen clashes.<br /><br />He said, “We initiated the conference that is to come up between April 26 and 29 under the ECOWAS Protocol on Free Movement of Persons, Goods and Services, zeroing particularly on the protocol on the movement of trans-humans which was signed in 1978 but yet to be implemented.<br /><br />“I&nbsp; had meetings with the President of ECOWAS Commission, the one that left, and we agreed to have this conference sometime last month. But because they were leaving and new set of management was coming in it was shifted to toward the end of this month.<br /><br />“So, the whole idea is to look at this issue of movements across borders.

The protocol provided for instance, that any of such movement, of trans-human should be received at the reception centre by the host country and their international trans-human certificates are supposed to guide them.<br /><br />“And not only that, they should also go along with international health certificates for the cattle they are going with.<br /><br />“So, if somebody comes in with 10 cattle for instance, and if he is going out with 20, you have to ask him questions because of the issue of cattle rustling.<br /><br />“We will also be able to know that the animals he is bringing do not carry diseases. We also want to be sure that they obey the laws of the country to the letter.<br /><br />“And the issue of carrying of arms because it is a no go area, we have zero tolerance to that because it is not part of the protocol. So, these are the issues that will be discussed at a high level ministerial conference which involves all ministers responsible for internal security and agriculture in all these countries, the 15 ECOWAS countries plus some of these countries in Central Africa, particular, Chad, Cameroun and Central African Republic. And also, it will involve Mauritania and Morocco. Mr. President has graciously agreed to open the conference on 26th, so it is of great concern to us.”<br /><br />On threats by Shiites to continue attacks in Abuja, the minister said, “I want to reassure you that law and order exist within the society and the FCT minister is very aware and is on top of it because of what happened recently. The Commissioner of Police is aware and is part of it.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, there was tension on Wednesday in Ughelli and its neighbouring communities as residents panicked on following sighting two military helicopters and military vehicles hovering and patrolling communities in Ughelli North Local Government Area of Delta State.<br /><br />The situation which almost led to a shutdown of social-economic activities in the area was learnt to be part of a two-day special combined operation of the Joint Task Force codenamed Operation Delta Safe and the Department of State Services over clashes between farmers and suspected Fulani herdsmen.<br /><br />It was gathered that the operation was targeted at discovering herdsmen’s camps in the area as part of measures to tackle the incessant farmers and cattle herders’ clashes in the area.<br /><br />&nbsp;Local sources said heavily armed soldiers stormed several communities in the area including Uwheru, Agadama and Ohoro communities which have been under herdsmen attacks.<br /><br />The military helicopters were said to have repeatedly hovered the area between 11.15am to about 1pm with vehicles patrolling the area till late Wednesday evening.<br /><br />Spokesman for Operation Delta Safe, Major Ibrahim Abdullahi, could not be reached for comment.<br /><br />However, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Andrew Aniamaka, confirmed the development in a telephone interview.

    "title": "March for Science: Stakeholders in Nigeria call for Adoption of Science to Achieve Food Security",
    "content": "As Nigeria joins the rest of the world to mark this year’s March for Science, stakeholders in the agricultural sector have harped on the need to use science to advance agricultural production in Nigeria in order to achieve food security.<br /><br />Science, which is evidence-based, has been used in most developed countries to advance food production through the improvement of yield per hectare and reduction in use of chemicals and pesticides and addressing the issue of climate change.<br /><br />This year’s March for Science attracted farmers, scientists and other stakeholders in the agricultural and other relevant sectors, to show solidarity to science and Nigerian scientists in their quest to develop technologies that will address food security.<br /><br />According to the Country Coordinator of Open Forum in Agricultural Biotechnology (OFAB), Dr Rose Gidado, the March was to align with the Nigerian scientists to make their voices heard so that they could be supported by the government to carry out more research to develop the Nigerian agricultural sector.<br /><br />“Science is one area that people find very difficult to understand, but with this march, we are bringing science to the street just for public understanding. We are engaging the public, to make them know that science is not mystic and shouldn’t be mystified, so science can actually do a lot,” Gidado said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WrSvKO8Bt4k/WtXlhWh13FI/AAAAAAAABbQ/a6vN-cMXTpMnZhoEXuwtu_AF24NwpoxNgCLcBGAs/s1600/March%2Bfor%2BScience.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-WrSvKO8Bt4k/WtXlhWh13FI/AAAAAAAABbQ/a6vN-cMXTpMnZhoEXuwtu_AF24NwpoxNgCLcBGAs/s320/March%2Bfor%2BScience.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Furthermore, she said the reason for the March was “to re-emphasize the role of science in national development. Science helps in mitigating the impact of climate change in our environment, in food safety and food production as well as increasing food production through biotechnology.<br /><br />“We have to speak up for science because science research is not gaining enough support it needs to drive the plan to revitalise Nigeria’s agricultural sector. We also want them to understand that we have able scientists in Nigeria.”<br /><br />Also, the Vice President of All Farmers Association, Chief Daniel Okafor said without science, the Nigerian agricultural sector will not witness remarkable development.<br /><br />He called for the support of Nigerian scientists by the government in the area of increased funding for research to enable them develop new varieties of crops that will make farmers witness greater yield.<br /><br />“I support science because without it the farmers cannot grow. Research has shown us in many ways that a lot is needed for farmers to perform very well. I advise people to adopt science because I have seen that without science we cannot have improved varieties of seeds.<br /><br />“With science, we can have a lot of improvement, and we are going to create a lot of jobs, because if a farmers gets five tonnes per hectare, with the involvement of science and research, the farmer can get up to 200 tonnes per hectare. So all these are the improvements science has brought to us. But people don’t understand, and that is why they are criticising the use of science in agriculture.<br /><br />“I will encourage and advise our scientists to do more research, because when they do research, the farmers will carry it up. When they are doing trials of any crop, we should be involved.<br /><br />“The government on their own part should fund research and biotechnology. The reason is because without that we cannot have increase in yield,” Chief Okafor added.<br /><br />In his address, the Acting Director-General of National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA),&nbsp; Abayomi&nbsp; Oguntunde, represented by Mr Osino Christian, said with the growing population of Nigeria, the need to adopt science to improve food production is imminent.<br /><br />“Modern science in Nigeria is awakened by the continuous and hard efforts of the outstanding scientists and researchers who attempt scientific advances of highest international calibre.<br /><br />“Just like other scientists across the world, Nigerian scientists have developed various scientific tools that can help in the area of food security, combating climatic change, which, the public have not been fully aware of.<br /><br />90% drop in food imports not good enough ―Buhari<br /><br />“At the current population of over 180 million people and projected population of 400 million people by 2050, Nigeria is faced with the risk of decreased farming population due to age; decreased arable land; poverty, malnutrition and hunger because the conventional method of agriculture can no longer meet up with our demand. Science holds the solution to our food security.<br /><br />“A country that cannot feed itself cannot have self-pride. The issue of food security therefore, requires that all hands be on deck for the reconstruction, revival and rejuvenation of our agricultural sector.<br /><br />“This March for Science therefore, has provided yet another opportunity for Science supporters to come together, join voices to amplify available Science-based solutions the nation can adopt to ensure food security,” Oguntunde said<br /><br />While wondering why Nigeria is yet to fully adopt Science in agricultural production, the NABDA DG, acknowledged that most developed countries have adopted Science as tool to improve their agricultural sector.<br /><br />“This brings the need to show support and confidence in scientific innovations set to improve livelihoods like agricultural biotechnology.<br /><br />“This technology as we probably know, feeds most developed countries like USA, Argentina, Brazil, Canada and have transformed farming to a profitable business, with the current state of Agriculture in Nigeria, it has become paramount to also adopt this technology to improve our productivity and revive our industries,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The Bankers’ Committee has begun the disbursement of the N26 billion fund accruing from the Agribusiness Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS), an initiative designed to improve access to affordable financing for medium, small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), particularly those operating in the informal sector of the economy.<br /><br />The Committee, at its 331st meeting of February 9, 2017, had initiated AGSMEIS with all deposit money banks, voluntarily agreeing to set aside and contribute five per cent of their profit after tax (PAT) annually to finance eligible projects under the Scheme.<br /><br />Speaking at the commencement of the disbursements to the first set of beneficiaries of AGSMEIS fund in Abuja thursday, the Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Mr. Godwin Emefiele said: “As at today, the size of the Fund stands at about N26 billion and this is expected to exceed N60 billion by June 2018. I am therefore very delighted that we have come to this stage where we are ready to begin the disbursement of these funds to deserving beneficiaries.<br /><br />“These beneficiaries are youths who have been trained on various entrepreneurship, vocational and management skills across the country by Entrepreneurship Development Institutions and Centres, such as Fate Foundation, Lagos Business School, House of Tara and Thrive Agric. Upon completion of their vocational training, the specific implements needed to practice their vocations, are procured under the scheme.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dM86EQ0cq7o/Wo6uEGE_TtI/AAAAAAAABGc/R1K9UPu1OCMW5Y7ZDLRcfPnJZYKMeRMTACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/emefiele.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"188\" data-original-width=\"268\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-dM86EQ0cq7o/Wo6uEGE_TtI/AAAAAAAABGc/R1K9UPu1OCMW5Y7ZDLRcfPnJZYKMeRMTACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/emefiele.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“The beneficiaries’ details including their Biometric Verification Numbers (BVN) are forwarded to the deposit money banks to confirm that they are their customers before accessing the fund. It is indeed an auspicious occasion as the outcome of today’s engagement is expected, in no half measures, to significantly, reduce youth unemployment and restiveness, increase social cohesion and drive inclusive economic growth.<br /><br />“In Nigeria, the challenges of youth unemployment and restiveness must be confronted with strategic innovative thinking to provide sustainable solution. No matter how daunting the challenge might seem, I believe that with unity of purpose we can fight this scourge together.”<br /><br />Emefiele noted that on his assumption of office in June 2014, his resolve and vision was to create a professional and people-centered central bank, with a focus on development financing, adding that the core of that vision was a CBN that will act as a financial catalyst by targeting predetermined sectors that can create jobs on a mass scale and significantly reduce the nation’s import bills.<br /><br />“The disbursement of funds under the Agribusiness/Small and Medium Enterprises Investment Scheme (AGSMEIS) is in line with that vision and a further testament of that resolve. I implore all beneficiaries here today and all youths that will key into this Scheme, to take good advantage of the opportunities made available to them and to utilise the funds judiciously, according to the terms of the loan agreements,” he said.<br /><br />Yesterday’s flag off saw the disbursement of materials worth N133 million to the first set of 358 beneficiaries to start businesses in their chosen fields.<br /><br />Emefiele stressed that the money was not free, and admonished that the beneficiaries should be strictly monitored to ensure repayment.<br /><br /><b>By: Ndubuisi Francis</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

No matter how daunting the challenge might seem, I believe that with unity of purpose, we can ﬁght this scourge together.<br /><br />“There is no gainsaying the fact that one of the most effective ways to tackle this scourge is through entrepreneurship development and easy access to affordable ﬁnancing. Yet, access to ﬁnance has been an Achilles heel on entrepreneurship development in the country today.<br /><br />“A situation often credited to ﬁnancial intermediaries’ apathy to youth entrepreneurship and start-ups, which are usually perceived as being too risky, lacking relevant managerial skills and not possessing.”<br /><br />He added that the AGSMEIS scheme would be implemented under three broad components of direct, indirect and developmental components.<br /><br />Under the direct component of the AGSMEIS, the CBN governor said beneﬁciaries could access loans to a limit of N10m at an interest rate of five per cent per annum and a maximum tenor of up to seven years.<br /><br />He added that there was also a moratorium period of 18 months on the principal and six months on the interest element, depending on the nature of the business.<br /><br />Under the indirect component of the scheme, the CBN governor said beneﬁciaries could access equity and quasi-equity investments of up to 10 years, with an initial lock-up period of three years before divestment.<br /><br /><b>By: Ifeanyi Onuba,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "In its determination to strategically create and empower agricpreneurs through sustainable genetic improvement, production, processing, storage, utilisation and marketing of tropical fruits, vegetables, spices and ornamental plants, the National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT), Ibadan in conjunction with Kord Resources Nigeria Limited has completed a three-day training programme for farmers in Ogun and Oyo States.<br /><br />The training opened new opportunities for farmers to learn newer techniques on how to improve the value chain production of plantain, banana and ginger to meet the international best practice.<br /><br />The three-day programme which was held at the Ogun-Osun River Basin Development Authority in Abeokuta, Ogun State, was expected to not only innovatively increase value chain production and yield of plantain, banana and ginger but to also open a new vista of opportunities for farmers to access ready-made market for their export products.<br /><br />Speaking at the value chain capacity building programme, the Acting Executive Director, National Horticultural Research Institute (NIHORT), Ibadan, Dr Abayomi Olaniyan, said the value chain capacity training was focused on plantain, banana and ginger to improve some production techniques, water management, economy of production, and processing of the crops among others.<br /><br />“Plantain, banana and ginger are important agricultural commodities and since horticulture is one of the viable and sustainable sources of earning fast income, employment generation and abrupt gross domestic product (GDP) and government revenue. for maximum yield.<br /><br />According to Olaniyan “Statistics shows that Nigeria is the fifth largest producer of plantain in the world and to maximise this potential we have to invest in areas of crop advantage by bringing in farmers in the key sector to make use of the programme to improve the value chain.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-trvvkL0hGdQ/WsyP9GyrrEI/AAAAAAAABZQ/Vs96u4YmyVAPbW4X2bGOHY7ZlUlCJgFswCLcBGAs/s1600/NIHORT.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-trvvkL0hGdQ/WsyP9GyrrEI/AAAAAAAABZQ/Vs96u4YmyVAPbW4X2bGOHY7ZlUlCJgFswCLcBGAs/s320/NIHORT.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“This programme will train people in the plantain, banana and ginger value chain to use different techniques to generate income and maximise yields in the production processes. It is also to create job for our teeming unemployed youths.”<br /><br />The NIHORT boss also revealed that Nigeria-grown ginger is one of the best in the world market with ready-made market.” It was on this premise that we deliberately focused on each zone’s comparative advantage (agricultural products) to fashion a wealth-driven value chain to get the product ready for export.<br /><br />“The crops we have added to the value chain capacity building programme have different stages of production which the farmers must know to get a required yield for harvest. So we are training farmers on the best practice acceptable in the world market; considering the fertilizer rate, pets and seeds control to get the global standards of export products.<br /><br />“We are also not stopping at training the farmers and participants on value chain of plantain, banana and ginger alone but we are also providing them with starter kits to help them start something immediate we conclude the training process.”<br /><br />The NIHORT boss added that after the South-West training the team will be moving to the South-South and South-East for the zone sets of training on other agricultural products, adding that two weeks ago the North Central had their schedule of the zonal training.<br /><br />The programme coordinator, Dr Olajide Taiwo, in his remarks said that the value chain training on plantain, banana and ginger will help participants in the areas of production, processing, packaging and marketing.<br /><br />“Basically this programme is to train people on how to create wealth from plantain, banana and ginger and a step forward to reduce unemployment, scarcity of materials and other agriculture challenges in the country.<br /><br />“And essentially we want you to acquire skills that will enable you to create jobs and wealth from the value chain of plantain, banana and ginger.<br /><br />Our investment in Lekki Free Zone ‘ll earn Nigeria N8trn annually ―Dangote<br />Speaking on the gap that exists in the agricultural value chain in Nigeria, Dr Sadiat Babalola, a resource person from NIHORT, said the gaps are of various aspects, which she itemised as, production activities, gap from moving from the traditional way of doing things; in making and producing seedlings.<br /><br />“We have to have an attitudinal change to move from the traditional way of doing things to the modern trend, in terms of production and maintenance techniques, which is the first aspect of the value chain.<br /><br />“Also there is a gap in converting our raw materials into finish products because the fresh produces are in the hinterland while the consumers are in the urban centres, which is also a gap.””<br /><br />“so there is need for the industry to be where the raw materials are in abundances instead of us transporting it from very long distances from the villages and the production centres to the processing centres.<br /><br />“in this regards, we need to bridge the gap from the traditional practices at every step to bring it to the present level so that we will be able to maximise the benefits of the horticultural crops.<br /><br />Speaking on how to bridge the gap the Dr Babalola said “In NIHORT we know we have to bring all actors together, so along the line we identified that we have to put into consideration how to do the sucker and production practise to gain more. So we have resource persons covering that aspect so that we can have our people even producing the suckers on a daily basis as a sustainable business.”<br /><br /><b>By: Wale Olapade&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Farmers to Generate N5.85bn Annually from Rubber Plantations in Southern Kaduna",
    "content": "<br />Farmers in southern Kaduna are expected to generate N5.850 billion annually from Rubber plantation, according to Dr Wuranti Valla, an official of the Rubber Research Institute of Nigeria (RRIN), Benin.<br /><br />Valla, a Chief Research Officer in the institute, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) on Monday in Manchok that 52 farmers, including the state government, had cultivated about 52 hectares of rubber plantations in six local governments.<br /><br />“Of the 52 farmers, 12 are from Manchok town in Kaura Local Government. They cultivate a total of 12 hectares of rubber plantations. The least farmer has 450 rubber trees while some have up to 2000 trees,” he said.<br /><br />He said that the remaining 40 farmers were scattered in five local governments – Jema’a, Kagarko, Jaba, Zango-Kataf and Sanga.<br /><br />According to him, farmers in Manchok, who planted in late 2007 when RRIN introduced the Rubber Project in the southern part of the state, have commenced tapping since October 2017.<br /><br />He said that the state government’s plantation, which is located in Sanga Local Government, was also being tapped.<br /><br />Valla, who described the project as a huge success, said that the farmers would “soon start smiling to the bank after about 10 years of investment, labour, hard work and endurance”.<br /><br />He said that each hectare contained 450 rubber trees, adding that a kilogramme of rubber currently sells at N250 in the international market.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gq7hPkycp2c/WsyNRMpmREI/AAAAAAAABY4/a3f9xGRVPw8LULAQKSwfNpUTnZsURfaqgCLcBGAs/s1600/Rubber%2BFarmer.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"253\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gq7hPkycp2c/WsyNRMpmREI/AAAAAAAABY4/a3f9xGRVPw8LULAQKSwfNpUTnZsURfaqgCLcBGAs/s320/Rubber%2BFarmer.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“Rubber is money because a single tree can produce about 1,000 kilogrammes of rubber annually. If you multiply N250 by 1,000, you will get N250,000 annually per tree.<br /><br />“For those with 450 trees, it means N112.5 million per hectare. If you value the 52 hectares being cultivated in the area, we are talking about N5.850 billion annually.<br /><br />“The market is there because the demand for rubber is high. It is the major raw material for companies manufacturing tyres, tubes, shoes, condoms, balloons, hand gloves, surgical instruments, among many others uses.<br /><br />“Already, there is a company from Delta State that has commenced tapping of about three farms in Manchok, but RRIN is making arrangement to buy off the rubber directly from the farmers to ensure a ready market,” Valla said.<br /><br />He said that agro-allied industries would soon spring up in the area following the growing of rubber plantations.<br /><br />“The weather is friendly and the soil is conducive for rubber trees. Farmers in this part of the country should take advantage of the project to improve their earnings,” he said.<br /><br />One of the farmers in Manchok, Mr Danladi Nache, who spoke with NAN, said that he was among the few farmers that keyed into the rubber plantation initiative when it was first introduced in Manchok in 2007.<br /><br />Nache described the 10 years of hard labour, huge investment and hard work required to nurture the rubber trees to maturity as a “herculean task”.<br /><br />“I planted 1,344 seedlings in 2007; by April 2009, 860 had died, leaving only 484. I had to constantly replace the dead ones and now I have about 900 trees, out of which about 200 are being tapped,” he said.<br /><br />He identified some of the challenges to include constant watering after planting the seedlings due to the shortage of rain between November and April, for the first three years.<br /><br />Other concerns, he said, included the attack by termites, bushfire, encroachment by herdsmen and vandalism by criminals that keep thwarting all efforts to fence the plantation with barbed wires.<br /><br />“It has not been easy, but I am glad that I remained focused and resolute to have come this far, and I am confident that my years of hard labour will finally pay off, now that my trees are being tapped,” Nache said.<br /><br />He thanked the RRIN for all the technical support, including local and foreign training to equip the farmers with all the basic knowledge and skills required to maintain rubber plantations.<br /><br />Another farmer, Mr Leo Shekari, a civil servant, who has about 200 trees in his plantation in Manchok, said he had to cross so many hurdles to nurture the trees to maturity.<br /><br />Shekari, who said that the plantation would occupy most of his time after retirement, declared that he had no regrets in spite of the years of endless toils and investment to ensure that the trees survived and grew to maturity.<br /><br />“I am happy to say that my plantation will be due for tapping, hopefully, by 2019. I am also confident that my children and their grandchildren will tap from the economic gains of my years of labour,” he said.<br /><br />On his part, Malam Tagwai Sambo, the Chief of Moro’a, who also has about 500 rubber trees already being tapped, described the development as a step toward opening the land for more investors.<br /><br />“We embraced the initiative when it was introduced in 2007. Not only did we plant the trees, we encouraged others to do so. I personally donated about three hectares to RRIN for demonstration.<br /><br />“The Kaduna State Government has equally given the institute 20 hectares so as to expand the cultivation of the economic tree in the southern part of the state.<br /><br />“The rubber trees currently being tapped, including my own, have shown that rubber trees not only flourish in our land but could also provide the high quantity of quality rubber,” Sambo said.<br /><br />The royal father, however, appealed to the RRIN to ensure the ready market for the farmers so that they could reap the benefits of their hard labour, endurance and perseverance.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the institute’s Head of Field Operations in Manchok, Mr Nwadiei Ugo, has said that the yield of the rubber plantations in Manchok was encouraging and had proven to be of high quality.<br /><br />Ugo particularly expressed surprise that 20 per cent of the trees currently being tapped in Manchok were filling their cups in the first five days as against just trickles usually recorded when tapping a new plantation in the south of the country.<br /><br />“We had to use a one-litre cup instead of a half litre to avoid wastage because of the high volume of the liquid rubber that flows from the trees.<br /><br />“Besides, only a few water content was discovered when we subjected the liquid rubber to test to determine the quantity of the coagulated rubber content. This is a further proof of the high quality of the rubber,” he said.<br /><br />Ugo called on other farmers to key into the project, pointing out that rubber plantations had huge returns on investment.<br /><br />“We have even introduced inter-cropping to allow farmers to cultivate other food crops alongside the rubber,” he stated.<br /><br /><b>Source: Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Ogbeh, Others Urge Creation of Ranches to End Herders-farmers Clashes",
    "content": "<br />Minister of Agriculture, Audu Ogbeh, yesterday declared that ranches remained the only panacea if the government was desirous to end the farmers-herders clashes across the country.<br /><br />Ogbeh, who briefed State House correspondents along with Governor Simon Lalong after a meeting of the Committee on National Food Security at the Presidential Villa, Abuja, yesterday ‎said that cattle in the country contributed six percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) hence the need to create an “environment where they have water, grass and security against rustlers.”<br /><br />The minister lamented that for nearly 40 years the country did not do much about the cattle sub sector which, he said, made it inevitable for the herdsmen to roam around.<br /><br />“The cheapest way of rearing cattle is by roaming around with them as you see now. If you go into a ranch, it is not cheap and government cannot subsidize cattle rearing like they do in Europe where they subsidize every cow with €6 which is about N2,400. We cannot afford that.<br /><br />“So the thing is, to create those ranches, the herdsmen must be prepared to pay tax to support the programme. If we don’t do it, next year will be worse than this year, I assure you.,” he said.<br /><br />Fielding questions, the minister said the committee at its meeting yesterday also discussed the price of goods in the market, availability of food and the challenges facing the country during emergencies, among others. He said the panel looked at other security issues, including those that impede on agriculture growth.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--snCZRrwqDM/WdsszL0A5WI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/Eq30N49sWZImvN2HEWUbvRJAnRLRyn5VwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/--snCZRrwqDM/WdsszL0A5WI/AAAAAAAAAQ4/Eq30N49sWZImvN2HEWUbvRJAnRLRyn5VwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Lalong said the committee would come up with recommendations for the setting up of what he called agro-rangers as part of the solutions to the farmers-herdsmen crisis.<br /><br />“Part of the recommendation we have made and we are working on, is the issue of agro-rangers. We noticed that if you are talking about farmers-herdsmen crisis, you have to train a specialized group of security outfit to handle those issues, it is not to concentrate on conventional security.<br /><br />“What we are still appealing to Mr. President to do is to hasten the process so that it can help solve some of the problems that we have in various states on the conflicts between farmers and herdsmen.”<br /><br />Governor of Ebonyi State, Dave Umahi, who also joined in the briefing, said the committee was poised to resolve the conflict between farmers and herdsmen in parts of the country.<br /><br /><b>By Terhemba Daka,</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "‘Farmers, Processors can Make more Money in Cashew Value Chain’",
    "content": "<br />The RMRDC is strengthening the cashew value chain as a valuable source of industrial raw materials to the Nigerian agro-economy. How would you describe the production level at the moment?<br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Although cashew was introduced in Nigeria more than 400 years ago, extensive cultivation started in the 1950s. The first Nigerian cashew plantation dates back to 1954 with 800 hectares in the present Enugu State and 200 hectares in the western part of the country.<br /><br />&nbsp; From 1965 to 1990, cashew production was relatively static at 25,000 tonnes with estimated land area of 50,000 hectares in 1990. Despite the initial problems, cashew cultivation has spread to 27 states of the country, and in the past 12 years, production increased almost thirty-fold from 30,000mt to 836,500 tonnes from estimated land area of 366,000 hectares in 2012.&nbsp;<br />&nbsp; Since the liberalisation of the commodity market in 1986, many companies have ventured into cashew processing.&nbsp; Nigeria has recognised the potential economic value of cashew and has made a concerted effort to improve the production of the crop.<br /><br /><b>Can you take us through some of the efforts that were made in the past to promote the value chain?</b><br />&nbsp;The Federal Government initiated a Cashew Development Programme under the Tree Crop Development Programme. The programme was initiated in 2001 to rehabilitate and resuscitate moribund plantations, train extension staff and farmers, provide and distribute inputs such as seedlings, agro-chemicals, etc.&nbsp; Other objectives of the programme were to promote quality control at primary (farm) level and the strengthening of management information system in the cashew sector.<br />&nbsp;Despite this, however, products of cashew tree (kernel and apple) are grossly underutilised for income generation. There is still a lot of wastages of the fresh apples on farms since a negligible portion is consumed by harvesters.&nbsp;<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DjoXfMOUn7A/WdcydtQmTRI/AAAAAAAAAQU/Ey5dkd883SwIWxYPBRLipQjMnqDbrzlUgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cashew.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"198\" data-original-width=\"254\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DjoXfMOUn7A/WdcydtQmTRI/AAAAAAAAAQU/Ey5dkd883SwIWxYPBRLipQjMnqDbrzlUgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cashew.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Also, Nigeria produces a limited variety of cashew, consisting mainly of the yellow and red varieties.&nbsp; However, high yielding cashew varieties with low gestation period and bigger nuts have been introduced.&nbsp;<br /><br />&nbsp;The Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN) that has the mandate to research into cashew development has developed an improved variety of cashew called Brazillian Jumbo, with nuts maturing within one year in contrast to the local wild varieties which mature after five years.&nbsp;<br />Currently in Nigeria, the major factors limiting cashew nut production are old age of most trees, deforestation, low yielding varieties, dominance of small holdings, dependence of most farmers on wild varieties, land acquisition problems, high cost of inputs, climatic conditions, disease, pest and fire outbreaks, high post-harvest losses, infrastructural constraints, as well as quality and market price of the product.<br /><br /><b>What are the factors affecting cashew production in the country?</b><br />&nbsp;Well, the major constraints are marketing and processing of cashew fruits. Producers have called on the government to arrest increasing transportation of the nuts into neighbouring countries, such as Togo, Benin and Cameroon, from where they are exported to Europe and the United States (U.S).<br />Also, prices of cashew nuts in international market impact significantly on its productivity. Good market prices are strong incentives for farmers, but when prices are low, farmers are weary of investing in any input since they cannot judge the return they might expect to receive for the crop at the end of the growing season.<br />The activity of middlemen, which reduces the amount that gets to farmers, also reduces profitability of farmers. In the Nigerian market, uncertainty is a very serious problem which can seriously limit cashew production and marketing as cashew farmers are left at the mercy of the middlemen,&nbsp; whose activities usually make prices to be low and damaging.<br /><br /><b>So how can Nigeria promote the cashew value chain?</b><br />&nbsp;One of the major ways of promoting development of the nation’s cashew output is through value addition.&nbsp; Cashew nuts are basic raw materials in the production of cashew nut butter.&nbsp; Further value addition to the kernels is possible by roasting and salting or sugar coating the nuts.&nbsp;<br />It is estimated that 60per cent of cashew kernels are consumed in the form of snacks while the remaining 40per cent is used in the confectionery industry.&nbsp;<br /><br />Presently, only 6per cent cashew apples produced is exported as producers have only market for the nuts. The problem is heightened as the use of whole fruit is commercially difficult as the apple ripens prior to the nut. The quality of the nut detached from the green fruit is unacceptable for processing as cashew apples must be produced within 2 to 3 hours of picking as they undergo rapid deterioration when kept for a long time. This perishable nature also negatively influences development of processing options for cashew fruits.<br /><br /><b>How would you describe the significance of cashew as a raw material? What is the RMRDC doing to increase production?</b><br />&nbsp;The RMRDC has initiated maintained and sustained a cashew development programme aimed at developing the value chain locally. Some of the industrial potentials of cashew, which are being exploited by the council are Cashew Nut Shell Liquid, juice and roasted cashew nut. Cashew nut shell contains inedible Cashew Nut Shell Liquid (CNSL), which consists of 15per cent of the gross weight while the nut contains Cashew Nut Kernel Oil (CNKO), which is sweet edible oil.&nbsp; The pressed kernel cake from CNKO extraction process is suitable for use in human and animal feeds.&nbsp;<br />The CNSL contains high proportions of phenolic compounds, which are used in industries as raw materials for making vehicle brake lining compounds, water proofing agents, preservatives, manufacture of paints and plastics; type-writer rollers, oil and acid-proof cements and for making industrial floor tiles, etc.<br /><br />In order to promote the sustainable supply of cashew to the processing plants, the council distributed 7,000 seedlings of improved cashew variety (Jumbo Cashew) to farms across the country during the 2015-2016 planting seasons. The project was handled by Abod Success Investment Limited.&nbsp; Some of the beneficiaries include: Alheri Agricultural Vine International Limited, Kaduna; Plant A Tree Today Initiative (PATTIN), Cadastral Zone, Apo, Abuja; African Foundation for Agricultural Development, Gudu District, Abuja; Christian Care for Widows, Widowers, the Aged and Orphans, Gwarinpa, Abuja; Danejo Farms Nigeria Limited, Babban Tunga, Niger State; National Cashew Association of Nigeria, Ilorin, Kwara State and Kogi State University, Anyigba, Kogi State and a host of others.<br /><br />&nbsp;The council, in collaboration with the Kogi State University, Anyigba, established a 1 tonne/day cashew nut processing plant for investment purposes. The cashew processing plant was fabricated and installed by a private consultant, Abod Success Investment Limited. The project was commissioned on October 14, 2010 and has since been producing cashew nuts on commercial basis.&nbsp; Likewise, the council collaborated with the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNAAB) to upgrade the cashew nut processing facility in the university. One tonne/day cashew nut processing plant was fabricated and installed by the council’s cashew consultant, Abod Success Investment Limited at the university.<br /><br />After a successful test-run and training of workers, the facility was commissioned on Wednesday, August 27, 2014. The plant has since commenced commercial production of cashew nuts.<br />The council has also collaborated with Isowopo Cashew Farmers and Sellers Association for the establishment of one tonne/day cashew nut processing plant at Ikakumo, Ondo State.&nbsp;<br />Furthermore, the council commissioned Abod Success Investment Limited to design, fabricate and install one tonne/day cashew nut processing plant at WEHSAC Farms Limited, Oke-Ogun, Oyo State. The council also commissioned Abod success Investment Limited to design, fabricate and install CNSL extraction plants at the Kogi State University, Anyigba and the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta. The extraction plants have been installed.<br /><br />To promote further value addition, Abod success was commissioned to design and fabricate cashew juice processing plants for the council.&nbsp; The plants would be deployed to the universities in Anyigba and Abeokuta for investment purposes.<br />The council is collaborating with the African Cashew Alliance (ACA), which is an international association of African and international businessmen with interest in promoting globally competitive African cashew industry.&nbsp;<br /><br />Presently, nearly 130 member countries work under the ACA banner and represent all aspects of cashew value chain, including producers, processors, traders and international buyers.<br />In&nbsp; 2017, we initiated collaboration with the Vietnam Institute of Agricultural Sciences for Southern Vietnam for transfer of technology on the grafting of cashew trees.&nbsp; The technology had been perfected and widely deployed in Vietnam.&nbsp; This has made Vietnam one of the competitive cashew producers globally.&nbsp; The major advantage of the technology is the possibility of grafting old trees for increased production and productivity without any need to cut them down.&nbsp; &nbsp;This initiative, if perfected locally as planned, will obviate the need to cut down old cashew trees locally, while at the same time increasing their productivity.&nbsp; As the old age of cashew is a major limiting factor influencing yield locally, the deployment of this technology will increase cashew production by more than 25per cent on annual basis.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Fish Farmers can Earn Huge Income with Right Species",
    "content": "<br />Commercial fish farming is rapidly becoming an economically successful venture across the globe.<br /><br />Fish farming is profitable and an excellent investment if, like any other business, it’s planned carefully and managed efficiently. Like many other forms of agribusiness, it takes experience to realise good returns.<br /><br />However, many investors enter the industry with insufficient capital and training, expecting overnight break-even, and then manage their business like a hobby farm. Many of their designs are inappropriate to their particular species and local climate and advice is taken from people not directly associated with aquaculture.<br /><br />One of the newest and most rapidly developing part of agriculture is that of growing animals in water. This science is called aquaculture. Many of the foods we eat were grown in the water. The amount of fish and seafood eaten by Nigerians is increasing each year.<br /><br />According to experts in the health sector, eating fish is nutritious and makes a good addition to the diet. It is high in protein and low in calories. The fat content is lower than that of red meat, and it helps prevent health problems. As people become more health conscious, the demand for fish and seafood will increase.<br /><br />This is the more reason people must invest in fish farming. Nigeria requires about 2.6 million metric tonnes of fish annually to supply the dietary requirement of its citizens.<br /><br />Daily Sun learnt that aggregate domestic fish supply is less than 0.7 million metric tonnes per annum. Consequently, approximately N98.5 billion is expended annually to augment the shortfall. This means Nigeria has heavily relied on importation to meet its needs.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-upY_9vChpU8/WstOt5gzLwI/AAAAAAAABYc/X6z291PRHDYAHEy5bfrJ3wF1EisC2RbKACLcBGAs/s1600/FISH.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"163\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-upY_9vChpU8/WstOt5gzLwI/AAAAAAAABYc/X6z291PRHDYAHEy5bfrJ3wF1EisC2RbKACLcBGAs/s1600/FISH.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Before now, most of the fish sold in the markets were caught from the wild. The ocean simply cannot sustain enough fish to meet the demand. To meet the demand, fish farms came into production. Fish are very efficient farm animals. This means that a pound of weight can be put on these animals with less feed than other agricultural animals.<br /><br />By far the most important food fish grown in Nigeria is the catfish. These are raised in all parts of the country because they are fresh-water fish. Catfish are different from most other fish. They have smooth skin instead of scales. They are meaty and have a mild flavour. Also, catfish fits well into farming operations because they are hardy and tolerate relatively low oxygen content in the water.<br /><br />The production of catfish begins with the breeding process. Through a system called selective breeding, superior fish are used to provide eggs for hatching. Factors such as growth rate and meatiness of the fish are used to determine, which fish are superior. In the future, fish farming will be about innovation, efficiency and sustainability.<br /><br />The President of Catfish Association of Nigeria (AFAN) once told Daily Sun that fish farming is profitable and that he trained all his children from fish farming business both abroad and in Nigeria. There was a case of a former 300 level Business Administration student of University of Abuja, Abdullah Al-hamza, who makes a net profit of about N45 million annually in fish farming. These people are successful because they obtained the right breed and pay attention to details.<br /><br />However, breed improvement is important in obtaining advanced and high yielding catfish. The main purpose of breed improvement is to introduce a positive characteristic into a local breed and take advantage of the observed improvement in performance of the progeny above that of either parent-hybrid vigour. Catfish has many different species namely, hetero branchus, clarias gariepinus, hetero clarias, etc.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Jovana Integrated Farms, Prince Arinze Onebunne, said it’s important for farmers to lay more emphasis on how to produce quality and fast growing fish because many producers who put their money in fish farming failed because of poor quality of the procured breed and insufficient knowledge.<br /><br />He added: “So look before you leap so that you don’t burn your fingers. I have seen farmers who don’t even know the fish breed in their pond. Farming with the right fish breed will guarantee profitability.<br /><br />“Fish breeding objectives should focus as follows: To breed fish brood stock with high fertility that, when combined with good management inputs, easily deliver thousands of fries, fingerlings and juveniles. To breed catfish that is hardy and display above average disease resistance with minimal animal health inputs.”<br /><br />He said before considering aquaculture as a business, much research on requirements should be done. He said the research should include marketing, stocking, feeding, water management, grading, harvesting, transport, appropriate fish species, materials and capital investments needed.<br /><br />According to him, the aim of every fish farmer is to breed a fish to one kg body weight or more in the shortest possible time, usually between four to five months if properly done. He explained that unit prices for table sized is between N500 and N600 per kg at the farm gate, N950 and N1,000 at the retail outlet, and N1,500 and N1,800 in the restaurants depending on the size.<br /><br />He said one gets more profit if operating a market outlet to cut off shylock middlemen, hinting that in all fish farms, the largest operating cost is feed. He said the advice here is that “you should get the right quality of food for your fish in order to achieve good yield. Therefore, you don’t have to depend solely on expensive imported feed, since one can learn to produce local cheap feed.”<br /><br />He maintained that people find it difficult to get the fast growing species of fish, adding that at Jovana Farms “we have quality fingerlings you can start your fish farming business with.”<br /><br />He said, “our breeds are functional, hardy and an economic asset for majority of our customers. Good hatching abilities significantly contribute to profitability in fish farming. Hardiness and disease resistance reduce your input costs and contribute to profitability.<br /><br />“Ignorance perpetuates failure and constant loss. I have seen farmers recording losses in their farms as a result of factors they could have changed. Therefore, people need to go for training before venturing into fish farming. Some people who started the business without the right species of fish or wit¡hout training have already shut down for lack of appropriate knowledge.”<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "How to Deal with Fungal Diseases in Vegetables, Leafy Plants",
    "content": "Fungal disease is a common threat experienced by farmers in raising vegetables and other leafy plants. According to just4growers.com, an agri-solution platform, some of the common fungal diseases that affect plants are:<br /><br />-Powdery mildew which appears like a greyish powder on either side of leaves, stems, fruits or flowers. It has the appearance of sprinkled powder on the plant.<br /><br />While some plants are more susceptible to the disease than others, plants are in a higher risk when they are undergoing vegetative growth. In addition, plants exposed to high levels of Nitrogen during this stage are at a greater risk of powdery mildew.<br /><br />-Botrytis, otherwise known as Botrytis blight or grey mould, is another fungal disease that can devastate both annuals and perennials. It may affect flower petals and buds causing them to decay and rot.<br /><br />-Rust is a fungal disease which forms rust-orange pustules on the undersides of leaves.<br /><br />Similarly, gardentech.com reports that in black spot disease, dark spots are seen on the upper sides of leaves and not on the undersides.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eDMvlL1vyCo/WdcySsFdxwI/AAAAAAAAAQY/M_DUfXbGZwg9mNRCt-zFsLFahNPkQiCOQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AGRIC-300x159.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"159\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eDMvlL1vyCo/WdcySsFdxwI/AAAAAAAAAQY/M_DUfXbGZwg9mNRCt-zFsLFahNPkQiCOQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AGRIC-300x159.jpg\" /></a></div><br />A point to note is that generally, fungal diseases thrive on weak plants under cool, damp, overcrowded and or water-logged conditions. This implies that they are more prevalent in greenhouses and indoor gardens.<br /><br />As reported by Pennsylvania State University’s website, organic extracts that are used in control of powdery mildew include potassium bicarbonate, sulphur and potassium silicate, while organic extracts for the control of Botrytis are copper and potassium silicate.<br /><br />Neem oil is also a good organic fungicide to use.<br /><br />However, an easy proven way to prevent powdery mildew according to growjourney.com is making a mixture of milk (30 per cent) and water (70 per cent) and spraying it evenly on the leave surface of affected plants. This should be done during morning hours of a sunny day.<br /><br />For inorganic control of fungal diseases, appropriate fungicides should be used.<br /><br />Good management practices like use of resistant varieties, removal and destruction of all infected plants and good farm hygiene should be practiced.<br /><br />Avoid splashing water on the leaves, as this can help spread rust.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why Nigeria’s Lagging in Date Palm Production",
    "content": "<br />Globally, Nigeria is the only country where date palms have two harvesting seasons in a year. Even in North Africa and the Middle East where the fruit originated from, they enjoy only one fruiting season.<br /><br />Date palm trees enjoy rainy and dry fruiting seasons in the savannah region of Nigeria which covers mainly the North West and North East.<br /><br />Dates grown in the region start flowering around January/February and become ripe for harvesting around June/July, while that of the rainy season start flowering around September/October and become ready for harvesting around February/March.<br /><br />However, despite this advantage of double harvesting in a year, the country produces less than 20 per cent of what is being consumed in the country as the remaining 80 per cent is imported.<br /><br />Speaking to Daily Trust on the cultivation of date in the country, the officer in charge of the Nigerian Institute for Oil Palm Research (NIFOR), Date Palm Research Institution Substation, Dutse, Jigawa State, Hamza Abdulhameed Mohammed, said the institution had come up with variety of seedlings capable of making the country the leading date palm producer in the world.<br /><br />Mohammed said the institute had produced seedlings of dried, semi dried and soft varieties of date palm and that the seedlings were produced in accordance with the variety of the mother tree.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fYVu0WVZPDE/WsXjiSYdWTI/AAAAAAAABYA/M-S_Saaz57Ebr4LlKV_tr9sEKcCxnrXPACLcBGAs/s1600/2018_4%2524large_Date_palms_plantation_in_Dutse%252C__Jigawa__State.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"364\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"176\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fYVu0WVZPDE/WsXjiSYdWTI/AAAAAAAABYA/M-S_Saaz57Ebr4LlKV_tr9sEKcCxnrXPACLcBGAs/s320/2018_4%2524large_Date_palms_plantation_in_Dutse%252C__Jigawa__State.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>He said the choice of the type of dates originates from the seedling that one wants to cultivate.<br /><br />On the date palm producing belt in the country, Mohammed, said apart from double harvesting, high yield of fruiting was also recorded in the country in Kano, Jigawa, Kaduna, Katsina, Sokoto,&nbsp; Kebbi, Zanfara, Gombe, Borno, Yobe, Bauchi, Adamawa and some parts of Taraba states.<br /><br />He explained that apart from promoting the cultivation of the crop for providing employment for the teeming unemployed youths, it could also be used as mechanism for fighting poverty as date was a cash crop.<br /><br />On post-harvest storage, Mohammed said dates could be stored for as long as a year or even beyond, provided there is effective storage management, otherwise it could easily be infested by pests.<br /><br />He noted that the best way to preserve dates is by leaving them on the bunch on layers of wood-supported mesh wire in a well ventilated store, and that under such condition, they could last for more than a year without a problem.<br /><br />Mohammed further stated that dates easily became infected if kept for long time in close contact with the ground and that they became easily infested because of their high sugar content.<br /><br />Local silo (rumbu) is another perfect place for storing dates considering the fact that such silo is suspended and its cover allows free movement of air.<br /><br />Speaking on the challenges associated with the cultivation of date palm, Mohammed said most of the local farmers believe that date palm is a desert crop and as such does not need water. He said this kill farmers’ spirit as eventually the trees hardly grew to fruition.<br /><br />He stated that despite the fact that date palm does not require much water, it does not mean that at infancy one could not water it, adding that ordinarily, a farmer ought to water&nbsp; his date palm at the beginning for at least two years.<br /><br />Another challenge in the cultivation of date palm is that of stray animals because of the fact that it is a perennial crop. In some cases, it may be the only available green crop and that makes it vulnerable.<br /><br />It was also identified that most of the local farmers of the crop do not go for the hybrid seedling.<br /><br />“Anywhere in the world, date has only one fruiting circle, apart from Nigeria where we have two circles. We stand this advantage because we are situated in a savannah. We have little bit more rainfall than North Africa and Middle East where date palm originated from.<br /><br />“The date-growing belt in Nigeria is North West and North East, while the North Central is the marginal date-producing zone. If you go to places like Abuja, Niger, Benue and the rest within the North Central, date palm can only bear fruits once a year, and the further you go to the coastal area, the trees can only grow vegetative, but cannot bear fruits.<br /><br />“You can keep a date fruit for as long as a year, but in places where there are proper storage facilities, the fruit can be stored for two years. A standard storehouse is the one with wooden mesh wire in layers. Weevils are the common insects that destroy dates. Weevils live on the mesocarp of date fruits,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By Aliyu M.

The announcement was made in a press release signed by 14 Commissioners of Agriculture and issued at the 2018 Annual Review and Work Planning Meeting of the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Cassava Weed Management Project tagged, ‘‘Unveiling of New Technologies for Weed Control in Cassava Farming Systems,’’ in Ibadan recently.<br /><br />The Ekiti State Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr. Peter Odebunmi, at the event said there were several rural farmers ignorant of how to get the best yield from their farms, adding that the outcome of the research on weed management will promote the economy of the individual farmers.<br /><br />Also speaking, the Commissioner for Agriculture for Edo State, Mr. Monday Osaigbovo, added that it was high time weed control gained attention. “If we do nothing to address weeds, we won’t be able to transform cassava in the country,” he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-84zAiFEKquE/WsHumAd13JI/AAAAAAAABV0/O_ytjcNVUB8s9pBLxQZV7CQmedQpzMxWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmers%2BWeeding.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"205\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-84zAiFEKquE/WsHumAd13JI/AAAAAAAABV0/O_ytjcNVUB8s9pBLxQZV7CQmedQpzMxWgCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmers%2BWeeding.jpg\" /></a></div><br />He stressed that to change the cassava story, there has to be a strong alliance with IITA Cassava Weed Management project, the Federal Government, state governments, the private sector, national research institutes, universities, and other stakeholders. While noting that Nigeria is the world’s largest producer of cassava, he said it is also important to know that cassava yield is low with FAO reporting a national average for Nigeria of 9.1 tonnes per hectare (ha) compared to Asian countries where yields are more than twice Nigeria’s national average.<br /><br />Over the last four years, the IITA Cassava Weed Management Project with donor support from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation has developed innovative packages to control weeds in cassava.<br /><br />Results presented by the Project Leader of the IITA Cassava Weed Management Project, Dr. Alfred Dixon, revealed that by switching to the innovative package developed by the Project, Nigerian farmers could record more than 20 tonnes per ha, up from 9 tonnes per ha has been reported by FAO as Nigeria’s national average.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Integrated Rice-Duck Farming’ll Boost Nigeria’s Food Security",
    "content": "<br />For many years, Nigeria has been struggling to attain self-sufficiency in rice production. Different programmes including the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP) have been introduced to reduce rice deficit in the country.<br /><br />Despite all these efforts put in place, Nigeria still remains the second largest importer of rice in the world, accounting for 25 per cent of the continent’s import. Local production is done on 2.8 million hectares of farmland.<br /><br />Nigeria produces 2.55 million metric tonnes of the estimated 6.1 million metric tonnes it consumes annually. It is further projected that Nigeria’s rice consumption will rise to 35 million metric tonnes by 2050, increasing at the rate of 7 per cent per annum due to estimated population growth.<br /><br />But experts believe that to feed the projected growing population, the Federal Government must consider Integrated Rice-Duck Farming (IRDF) technology since the conventional ways of planting rice in the country cannot meet demand.<br /><br />Rice-duck farming is an integrated type of farming technology, that is especially suitable for resource poor farmers to produce organic rice at low cost.<br /><br />The evidence from various Asian countries&nbsp; including India, Japan, Bangladesh, Philippines, Vietnam and some other countries, has proved the integration of ducks in rice field as a successful and productive farming technology.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EiP6dhgvrl4/WsHtKGUH-oI/AAAAAAAABVo/J_JJR62vHWYOdjaanZg_vjyOPDwTfLRowCLcBGAs/s1600/Integrated%2BRice%2Band%2BDuck%2Bfarm.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"182\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EiP6dhgvrl4/WsHtKGUH-oI/AAAAAAAABVo/J_JJR62vHWYOdjaanZg_vjyOPDwTfLRowCLcBGAs/s1600/Integrated%2BRice%2Band%2BDuck%2Bfarm.jpg\" /></a></div>Daily Sun investigation revealed that integrating ducks in rice farming have been proven to increase 30 per cent higher yield with about 60 per cent higher net return.<br /><br />This technology has also proven to be far better than conventional ways of growing rice as the same cultivation area can be used for not only rice production but also subsidiary products like meat and eggs. At the same time it reduces labour inputs through control of weeds and insects by ducks.<br /><br />Experts are of the opinion that growing rice and ducks together in an irrigated paddy field could well be a solution to providing food security for a surging population in any developing nation. This method of farming has reduced poverty, hunger and brought inclusive growth to a large segment of the population in the Philippines.<br /><br />Technically, if government can invest and empower farmers to adopt the technology, Nigeria will save $300 million in import substitution annually.<br /><br />According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations&nbsp; (FAO), IRDF technology will enable farmers grow rice without using pesticide or herbicide. They will also earn extra money when the fully grown ducks are sold or when they start laying eggs.<br /><br />The UN agency said, “beside its economic benefits, this technology is especially environmental-friendly. The application of synthetic fertilisers and pesticides can be reduced thereby improving soil quality and pest control.<br /><br />“The additional benefits of this good practice option are a higher food security to small farming households in times of calamities and on long-term basis the contribution to reduce methane emission. Hence, integration of duck in lowland rice production is recommended as climate adaptation and mitigation option.”<br /><br />Therefore, experts urged the Federal Government to partner FAO and one the Asian countries to adopt integrated rice-duck farming by training a large number of Nigeria’s farmers to embrace the technology.<br /><br />A Bio-technology Engineer, Roshan Shetty, who runs an AgroBioTech Channel in India told Daily Sun that the IRDF, in which ducks feed on insects and weeds in paddies and fertilise rice plants, has been a flagship of Asian sustainable agriculture movements.<br /><br />He added: “Farming is being revolutionised by a technological wave. That’s great news. By 2050, the earth’s population will be 10 billion, so we need to almost double the amount of food we now produce.”<br /><br />Speaking on the benefits of rice-duck farming, Shetty said ducks eat harmful insects and weeds, thereby averting the use of chemical pesticides and manual weeding in the rice field, adding that ducks get nutritious diet from eating insects and weeds in rice fields.<br /><br />He explained that the droplets of ducks act as natural fertiliser to the rice crop preventing the use of chemical fertilisers. He said the continuous movement of ducks in the rice field provides natural stimulation and aeration, which increase the availability of nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorous and potash to the rice crop.<br /><br />He hinted that rice-duck technology causes a reduction of emission of methane gas from rice field, contributing to reduce the global warming.<br /><br />Experts have also proved IRDF technology to be beneficial in terms of providing social, economic and environmental benefits. In this type of farming technology, ducks are released in the field after 10-20 days of rice transplantation till the time of flowering. The integration of ducks in rice field creates symbiotic relationship between rice and ducks yielding mutual benefits to both entities.<br /><br />In the medium to long-term, the adoption of the IRDF will contribute to improve the quality of life of farmers, as evidenced by increased savings and income, better family nutrition (chemical-free rice, duck meat and duck eggs), and a healthier lifestyle brought about by less exposure to harmful chemicals.<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigeria Grain Production Fluctuates – FAO",
    "content": "<br />A recently released quarterly report on crop prospects and food situation of the United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) reveals that there has been a drop in the total coarse grains produced in the country.<br /><br />Nigeria, which produced 19.1 million tonnes of coarse grains in 2015, dropped to 18.9 million tonnes in 2016; the production slightly picked up to 19 million tonnes in 2017.<br /><br />However, for rice production, Nigeria witnessed a consistent rise from 4.8 million tonnes in 2015, to 5 million tonnes in 2016 and consequently 5.4 million tonnes in 2017.<br /><br />According to the report, the country’s overall cereals production (including wheat, rice and coarse grains) which was 23.9 million tonnes each for both 2015 and 2016 increased considerably to 24.4 million tonnes in 2017.<br /><br />In another vein, the report showed that Nigeria’s total cereals stock based on aggregate of carryovers at the end of national crop years has been fluctuating from 2013 to 2018.<br /><br />Based on official and non-official estimates of the FAO, Nigeria’s cereal stock in 2013 was 2.8 million tonnes, which nosedived to 1.3 million tonnes in 2014.<br /><br />For the years 2015 and 2016, the country’s cereal stock increased to 2.9 million tonnes each while the stock slightly decreased to 2.7 million tonnes in 2017, going further down to 2.1 million tonnes in 2018.<br /><br />In the same report Nigeria, which was categorised under the low income food deficit countries, had commercial purchases (and/or imports) of cereals of 7,250,000 tonnes between January and December 2016 marketing year, while the country’s estimated total import requirement for 2017 was 7,360,000 tonnes.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pii7mgmP1l4/WrzKvLj1BXI/AAAAAAAABUY/C9Gfe0b8tvYzMcaH_dVpoGnlqKdtnBYKACLcBGAs/s1600/Cereals%2BStock%2Bof%2BNigeria.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"379\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"183\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Pii7mgmP1l4/WrzKvLj1BXI/AAAAAAAABUY/C9Gfe0b8tvYzMcaH_dVpoGnlqKdtnBYKACLcBGAs/s320/Cereals%2BStock%2Bof%2BNigeria.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />There was no data available for Nigeria on the estimated cereal import requirements for 2017/2018 marketing year.<br /><br />Reacting to this development, an agric expert, Dr Innocent Okuku, confirmed that farmers generally tended to migrate from the production of crops that bring higher income from sales, which explains why there was a decline in production of some crops.<br /><br />Dr Okuku reaffirmed that Nigeria was a low income country judging from the N18,000 being paid to workers as minimum wage which was around 50USD to 60USD per month.<br /><br />He explained further that the amount translated to just about 1.5USD per day thus categorising the receiver as a low income person. This, he said, was in addition to high level of youth unemployment in the country.<br /><br />Dr Okuku noted that the fraction that have a reasonable income or earning of about 20USD to 30USD per day make up the smaller percentage of the country’s population.<br /><br />On Nigeria falling under the food deficit countries classification, he also asserted that Nigeria was a food deficit country because there is higher importation of food than export.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br /><br />Okuku stated that although Nigeria was gradually growing its food production, in addition to efforts by the present administration to boost especially rice production, the shift in lifestyle and nutritional pattern among Nigerians and deficit between consumption and supply means Nigeria’s food production is still lagging behind.<br /><br />He noted that many industries still import the raw materials they need to carry out production activities, citing example with the confectionary industry which, he said, majorly imported wheat they use for production.<br /><br />The expert explained that small-holder farmers tend to shift to cultivation of crops that receive greater public attention and government support and financing at the detriment of other cereal crops traditionally produced by them.<br /><br />He proclaimed that more land has been put to rice production which was why there was a shortfall in production of the other cereal crops, adding that sorghum and millet cultivation was done mostly at subsistence level and only the excess gets to the markets.<br /><br />He held that the only way Nigeria could get out of the situation was to become a net exporter of food by developing power and infrastructures. This way, he said, the country can adequately compete at international markets and generate the foreign exchange necessary for growth and development of its agricultural sector and the country at large.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "6,536 Farmers Benefitted From IFAD Programme In Ogun —Coordinator",
    "content": "<br /><b>What is the essence of the programme?</b><br /><br />The essence of the programme going on today is a mid-term review. The programme is a six-year programme and we have gone midway in the implementation of the programme. So, it becomes very imperative for the review of how far, how well have been done. What has worked with respect to the processes put in place; what has not worked well so that we can review those processes and see how we can better implement going into the second half of the programme.<br /><br /><b>You mentioned that 6,536 farmers have been profiled and trained with N242m paid as counterpart fund. How has this translated to rice and cassava production in the state?</b><br /><br />It’s necessary to state the facts correctly that the 6,000 farmers you are talking about are just in five local governments because the programme is only being implemented in five local governments namely Obafemi-Owode, Yewa North, Ijebu North East, Ijebu East and Ifo local government. And because of that, you may see that the number of farmers you are talking may not represent the entire farmers we have in the state. But the impact of this on cassava and rice value chain cannot be over-emphasized. One, there has been increase in the yields of rice and cassava in the state. The programme’s beneficiaries contributed immensely to the MITROS rice programme that took off in the state in 2017 and there is an increase in off-taking of cassava by some of the major processors that we have in the state.<br /><br />FG launches new climate change insurance for farmers<br /><br /><b>The main objective of the programme is to encourage cassava and rice value chain. Are there plans to extend it to other food and cash crops?</b><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-01qQF3-bRjI/WeRkLsFhLxI/AAAAAAAAAYs/iqXsQvFi3Yc_fkt_hcP4-FHpJP4osacSQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/IFAD.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"199\" data-original-width=\"254\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-01qQF3-bRjI/WeRkLsFhLxI/AAAAAAAAAYs/iqXsQvFi3Yc_fkt_hcP4-FHpJP4osacSQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/IFAD.jpg\" /></a></div>The objective of the programme is to increase the incomes and productivity of small holder farmers in cassava and rice value chain. So, with that, we believe that with the little successes that we’ve had, the value chain approach can be used to develop the other stocks and even the livestock and fisheries industry.<br /><br /><b>What is the target for the remaining part of the programme?</b><br /><br />The target for the remaining half of the year is to be able to fully implement, ensure that the incomes of our farmers in these participating local governments have increased by over 25 percent by the end of this project. Equally, we expect that our farmers should be able to produce to the point wherein the market can absorb close to 70 percent of their produce without jeopardising their food security.<br /><br /><b>On a general assessment, would you say the programme has been serving the purpose of creation?</b><br /><br />Well, without being immodest, the project has made some significant contribution and impact in the participating local governments.<br /><br /><b>What are the challenges so far?</b><br /><br />Some of the challenges; we are dealing with small holder farmers who are rural poor. So, their being able to meet some of their own contributions, at times, have been very difficult. Two is the issue of this farmers/herdsmen which we are also looking at how that can be resolved by encouraging some of these herdsmen to become part of the farmers groups so that they can also begin to have ownership, sense of belonging in the communities.<br /><br /><b>Now that we are into another planting season, are there any plan for rice and cassava increase in production?</b><br /><br />For those of them that have enjoyed the grant for two years, they are going to be wind off and that’s why we are interfacing with the state government. The state government is coming also to be off-takers; that is assuring the farmers, particularly for rice, that no matter what they produce, it will be off-taken in the state. So, that alone is a kind of encouragement to farmers to go ahead that government is ready to off-take with respect to rice.<br /><br /><b>By Olayinka Olukoya</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Scientists Inaugurate Second Phase Of NextGen Cassava Project Nigerian Farmers To Access It Next Year",
    "content": "<br />Scientists and officials from Cornell University and the Tanzanian Ministry of Agriculture officially inaugurated the second phase of a project with targeted at revolutionizing breeding programs and agriculture in Africa through cassava.<br /><br />“Another five years will help us strengthen the long-term global sustainability of cassava — a crop important for food security and predicted to stand up to climate change and extended periods of drought or rain,” said Ronnie Coffman, international plant breeder and director of Cornell’s International Programs in the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences who administers the Next Generation Cassava Breeding Project (NextGen Cassava).<br /><br />“We have the next five years to be very courageous in delivering best bet varieties resilient to major diseases for African farmers,” said Chiedozie Egesi, project manager for NextGen Cassava. “Cassava can be the engine that will revolutionize agriculture in Africa.”<br /><br />Cocoa farmers allege importation of substandard inputs by ministry<br /><br />Cassava which is widely considered as a ‘poor man food’ may seem an unlikely focus for a flagship project, is the fourth most consumed staple in the African continent after maize, rice and wheat. Yet it is exactly in this gap of knowledge that the possibility for innovation exists.<br /><br />In the first five years of the project, funded by a grant from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and UK aid, NextGen Cassava researchers and partners made major strides in understanding cassava’s genome and flowering, shortened the time to develop new cassava varieties from eight years to five, identified user preferences important to men and women to incorporate into breeding targets, and established Cassavabase, an open-access database for cassava genomic information.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fXUI5e92RbA/WhfuL_in4OI/AAAAAAAAA0w/guwn64nwNA8a6dw0-aeMsP_qzr40Z5-BgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cassava.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"403\" data-original-width=\"842\" height=\"153\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fXUI5e92RbA/WhfuL_in4OI/AAAAAAAAA0w/guwn64nwNA8a6dw0-aeMsP_qzr40Z5-BgCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Cassava.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br />In the second phase of the project, greater emphasis will be placed on delivering improved cassava varieties to smallholder farmers and end-users throughout sub-Saharan Africa. The first varieties from NextGen will be available to farmers in Nigeria within the next 18-24 months.<br /><br />“A key goal in Phase 2 is to identify traits important to a diverse range of users–including women and marginalized groups–and to engage farmers as research partners to breed new varieties that are adopted and equitably impactful. It is to everyone’s benefit to hear women’s voices and tap into their knowledge about product quality to breed better cassava for everyone,” Coffman said.<br /><br />“I consider this a very important investment for the people of Tanzania, Nigeria and Uganda, especially the farming community,” said Dr. Mansour Hussein, director of R&amp;D at the Ministry of Agriculture in Tanzania. “I believe the approach taken by NextGen will ensure that the concerns of farmers will be addressed.<br /><br />Like many African countries, agriculture plays an important role in Tanzania’s economy, employing over 75 percent of the country’s workforce and accounting for 25 percent of the National Gross Domestic Product. Cassava’s contribution to this sector is limited by lack of access to disease-free planting materials, use of poor farming practices, high post-harvest losses, and low-yielding varieties.<br /><br /><b>By Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Farming in Nigeria and Danger of Snake Attacks",
    "content": "<br />The recent recession that ravaged our economy has opened a new vista for many Nigerians to consider taking opportunities in the agricultural sector of the economy to overcome the excruciating pains of lack of resources to tackle individual needs.&nbsp; The impetus Federal government added to this sector through Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP) had propelled more Nigerians to have hope in the development of the agro-allied and Agric business which had resulted in utilization of land that had aggravated conflict between farmers and snakes on farmlands.<br /><br />From time immemorial, land issues have always been a problem within communities, states, and countries based on the economic value it commands. It has caused war within families, communities, states, and countries and will continue to be an issue human race dwells on because of the population explosion, economic values, and political considerations. However, the danger posed by reptiles on farmlands has not been given due priority it deserves by local, state and federal governments.<br /><br />The increasing number of people that are into farming activities has started gaining traction in Nigeria because of the enormous benefits of agriculture. The Anchor Borrower Programme (ABP) had added impetus to agricultural policy of this present government and provided leeway for states in the country to project areas of their competitive advantage in agriculture.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HnY1TBOPKX0/WdcyroMCzwI/AAAAAAAAAQU/AzfYlM1zzNoDMlBpt4ZtlJpo_jUem42nQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmer2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"413\" data-original-width=\"734\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HnY1TBOPKX0/WdcyroMCzwI/AAAAAAAAAQU/AzfYlM1zzNoDMlBpt4ZtlJpo_jUem42nQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Farmer2.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The programme was launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015, with intent to create a linkage between anchor companies involved in the processing and smallholder farmers (SHFs) of the required key agricultural commodities.&nbsp; According to Central Bank of Nigeria, the programme thrust of the ABP is the provision of farm inputs in kind and cash (for farm labour) to smallholder farmers to boost production of these commodities, stabilize inputs supply to agro-processors and address the country’s negative balance of payments on food. At harvest, the SHF supplies his/her produce to the Agro-processor (Anchor) who pays the cash equivalent to the farmer’s account. The programme evolved from the consultations with stakeholders comprising Federal Ministry of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development, State Governors, millers of agricultural produce, and smallholder farmers to boost agricultural production and non-oil exports in the face of unpredictable crude oil prices and its resultant effect on the revenue profile of Nigeria.<br /><br />With this development, appreciable numbers of the population are into farming activities, especially in the rural areas. However, the policy did not take note of the implication of having more people on farmlands and the attendant collusion with the permanent residents of the land which are rodents and reptiles.<br /><br />The herculean task of clearing the field, planting seeds and harvesting of produce is been hampered by the encounter of the farmers with snakes on their farms. Many have been bitten and it has resulted in deformity and in many cases outright fatality.<br /><br />For instance, when rice farmers work on their farmland to thresh rice, snakes go under heaps of rice gathered together during preparatory for threshing, in search of shelter from the scorching sun. Such snakes pounce on farmers when they open the heaps to start thrashing. Some snakes also move in groups in search of rats at yam farms where they clash with farmers harvesting the produce.<br /><br />Victims of snakebites have always resorted to local herbs to treat themselves as access to anti-venom are limited in the majority of our rural areas. Snakebite treatment needs urgent attention to avoid death and distance from farmland to location where help could be rendered play a crucial role in the treatment of victims.<br /><br />The exposure of farmers to snakes on farms needs urgent attention in order to preserve the life of our hard-working farmers. It is well known that majority of farming activities take place in rural areas where lack of good roads and health facilities have been an issue that local and state government has not been able to resolve.<br /><br />From News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) report of November 5, 2017, two hundred and fifty victims of snakebite had died in Plateau and Gombe states, following an acute scarcity of snake anti-venom drugs in the country. The figure represents the number of confirmed deaths from three snake treatment centres – General Hospital, Kaltungo, Ali Mega Pharmacy, Gombe and Comprehensive Medical Centre, Zamko, Plateau State.<br /><br />Considering the unreported cases and if those that have been maimed across the country on the farmlands, is added to the reported cases, it is alarming enough for concerted effort&nbsp; to address this issue.<br /><br />The commonest snakes involved are mainly the Carpet Viper (Echis carinatus), Puff Adder (Bitis Arrieta) and the Spitting Cobra (Naja Nicocolis). According to a study made by Federal University Kashere, Gombe State, snake bites are common during hot season when most of them are out of their burrows due to excessive heat. In the cold weather, the biting frequency is low but with higher toxicity due to a higher concentration of the venom.<br /><br />Snakebites negatively affect the lives of thousands, mostly the rural poor and result in declining subsistence agriculture and overall quality of life of the people.&nbsp; The rate of attacks on farmlands can spell doom to agricultural policy of government if urgent attention is not taken to address this problem.<br /><br />This issue has affected a productive sector of the economy through death and deformity of our farmers. It has also added a financial burden to the family of the victims in the rural areas. Majority of our rural farmers that fall victims to snake bites cannot afford the cost of treatment and usually resorted traditional methods of treatment.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;Lack of attention by government agencies has created room for desperate individuals to produce fake drugs in order to take advantage of the inadequate supply of imported anti-venom drugs.<br /><br />Kazeem writes from Lagos<br /><br />It is heartwarming to confirm that&nbsp; Federal University Kashere, Gombe State, has been able to research on various plant extracts with proven efficacy used by local herbalists in the management of snake bite. They have administered these extract on victims in the hospital and confirm the efficacy of these extracts. What is&nbsp; next for the institution is to confirm the side effect of the plants and evaluation of shelf life as well as epidemiological data which require funds for them to continue with their research activities.<br /><br />More funds should be allocated to research institutes and the University to enhance their activities and modalities should be put in place to address the issue of nepotism in the university in the allocation of funds to researchers. The idea of not been in the good book of Vice Chancellor before lecturers are allowed to benefit from research grant should be look into by National University commission.<br /><br /><br /><br />The government should treat local production of anti-venom as a national and security issue in order to substitute continuous importation of anti-venom for local production. In view of the rising cost of a dollar, the government must encourage and support research institutions with funds to domesticate the production of the anti-venom treatment kits<br /><br />Embarking on public enlightenment among rural communities on how to prevent snakebites would involve giving timely first aid. Such emergency and vital information should be made available in the languages that local farmers are familiar with.<br /><br />Relevant government agencies should raise communities’ awareness and knowledge among general public about the correct first aids for snake bites. Also, sensitization campaign on the risk and prevention by wearing appropriate footwear on farmland is vital.<br /><br />There is the need for Improvement in the training of medical personnel to tackle the issue of snake bites and training of the community to enable them to administer first aid&nbsp; treatment as well as making the first aid kits available in the rural communities in the country.<br /><br />National Assembly should expedite action on a bill for the establishment of a national centre for research and production of snake’s vaccines. Not only that, Public-Private- Partnership arrangement between government and Echitab Study Group should be finalized to enable Nigeria to produce the treatment kits in Nigeria.<br /><br />Federal Ministry of Science and Technology, Ministry of Education and Industry, Trade and Investment and their relevant agencies should collaborate and synergize with private sectors to actualize local production of anti-venom in the country by galvanizing and linking research effort of our institutions into a commercially viable venture.<br /><br />Bolaji O.

    "content": "<br />The Executive Director, Business Development of Nigerian Export-Import Bank (NEXIM), Mrs Stella Okotete, has revealed that the bank is seeking partnership with Ondo state on cocoa projects and other commodity exporters to scale up export trade.<br /><br />The Head, Strategy and Communications at NEXIM Bank, Mr. Tayo Omidiji, in a statement in Abuja, Wednesday disclosed that Okotete spoke when the bank’s management team visited business operators and major projects in Ondo State.<br /><br />She said the visit was aimed at ensuring a collaboration that would facilitate export in the state.<br /><br />While speaking, Okotete noted that cocoa was a leading non-oil export commodity from Nigeria and it was necessary to seek partnership with Ondo being a main cocoa-producing area.<br /><br />She informed that currently, the country exports mainly raw cocoa beans but consumed much more than its revenue to import chocolates and other finished cocoa products, adding that NEXIM was eager to reverse the trend, and in the process, enhance jobs and advance export revenues.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzBkf7EyQVk/Wrihz1k92qI/AAAAAAAABTE/IxXZDB2UenElZTByljkgLzbGhrxomAS5wCLcBGAs/s1600/nexim-300x106.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"106\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NzBkf7EyQVk/Wrihz1k92qI/AAAAAAAABTE/IxXZDB2UenElZTByljkgLzbGhrxomAS5wCLcBGAs/s1600/nexim-300x106.png\" /></a></div><br />She noted that the bank had started receiving applications under the N5OO billion Export Stimulation Facility, which it executed with the Central Bank of Nigeria, adding that the funds had been created to provide long term facilities to exporters at single digit interest rate.<br /><br />She informed that N1 billion of the N50 billion Export Development Fund was organised for the purpose of supporting Small and Medium Enterprises, operating along the export value chain, and added that about N3 billion had also been reserved under a special scheme programmed for women and youth.<br /><br />Speaking on support for the Niger Delta Region, she disclosed that a Niger-Delta Development Fund had been established in conjunction with the Niger-Delta Development Commission, with a seed fund of N5 billion to encourage export-oriented projects.<br /><br />Okotete revealed that while the bank’s management team was on a courtesy visit to the state, Gov.

    "title": "Moringa? It’s big Money for Farmers, Investors",
    "content": "<br />Moringa&nbsp; farming has continued flourishing and creating enormous benefits for mankind. It is a plant said to have huge potential to boost farmer’s income, develop any nation’s economy and generate employment.<br /><br />Although Nigeria’s soil is good for this amazing cash crop, its full potential is yet to be tapped into by farmers in the country. But many farmers who seize opportunities it offers, earn a living from it.<br /><br />Moringa is known everywhere for it’s medicinal uses. It is regarded as the tree of life. The medicinal benefit of this tree makes it superior to other trees. Both the seeds and leaves are useful. The seeds and leaves are money!<br /><br />Investors or intending farmers can make good money from the sale of Moringa seedlings, Moringa oil, Moringa tea, Moringa capsules, Moringa powder, are among the many formula.<br /><br />Moringa farming business is not like any other annual crops farming such as maize, rice or beans. Though, moringa products are highly expensive and it takes comparatively little investment to set up a moringa farm.<br /><br />One good thing about the crop, for instance, if one set up moringa plantation, he will continue making money from it yearly. Most times 3 months after planting. Moringa leaves can be harvested after 90 days of planting.<br /><br />Due to its economic, medicinal and health benefits, the demand is huge in USA, China, Vietnam, India and other European countries.<br /><br />Daily Sun learnt that Chinese, Indians, Veitnamese and South Korea companies are all over Lagos looking for Moringa seeds, as a bag of moringa seed costs N150,000 to N170,000 depending on the weights. In Kano state, the Chinese usually pay a moringa farmers in advance far ahead of the harvesting period.<br /><br />In Zamfara alone, a trader in moringa seeds rakes in N6 million every year because the seed has more monetary value than the leaves with a kilo of it sold for N1,800 to N2,000.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYHozDL_NqE/WrigcC3lgEI/AAAAAAAABS4/tpcwXOeAc9kHi2eqs26oc1zroZcfNPMdQCLcBGAs/s1600/Famer-300x157.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"157\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-FYHozDL_NqE/WrigcC3lgEI/AAAAAAAABS4/tpcwXOeAc9kHi2eqs26oc1zroZcfNPMdQCLcBGAs/s1600/Famer-300x157.jpg\" /></a></div><br />During the raining season, farmers can harvest at least three times a season, depending on the size of the farm.&nbsp; With less effort, a small size of land can accommodate many stems that can within a short period grow and produce the seeds that can be used for export, where they are processed for both consumption and value addition.<br /><br />The crop is being used by pharmaceutical, perfumery, trado-medical practitioners, and food industries as its leaves and other parts are useful as medicine for treatment of ailments.<br /><br />Looking at the in-depth health benefits of Moringa leaves, stem, root, and seeds, scientific studies have shown that it contains specific antioxidants and health promoting ingredients that offer palliatives to malnutrition, hunger and diseases. The early leaves are edible and are commonly cooked and eaten like spinach or used to make soups and salads.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, the Deputy Managing Director of Peniel Gerar International Limited, a seed company, Ojiefoh Enahoro Martins, said farmers can always get good seeds from existing farms, advising that seed selection is a major key factor one must take very serious as a new farmer or investor.<br /><br />He said Oyo, Benue and Edo states have more of moringa and farmers could get good seeds in these states. He said moringa has short term maturation period, which makes it more advantageous for investors, unlike other tree crops like&nbsp; cashew and cocoa.<br /><br />Said he: “I will advice farmers and investors&nbsp; to embrace moringa farming as a business because&nbsp; the demand keep increasing on daily basis. Moringa&nbsp; is a friendly crop and very easy to&nbsp; manage. In 2017, I ran out of supply, I traveled&nbsp; to over 6 states looking for moringa for my foreign buyers.”<br /><br />He added: “Recently,&nbsp; some communities in plateau state&nbsp; embrace&nbsp; moringa in large scale. It does not cost anything to go into Moringa farming. All you have to know and need is to get a land may be an hectare, get the right seeds, get a good flat land and there is no fixed&nbsp; price for seeds but i sell at N200 per nurse seedlings, understand&nbsp; the early management&nbsp; process, protect your&nbsp; farm from domestic animals like goats and&nbsp; Rams. Cows and goats are the major setback&nbsp; in moringa farming.<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota;&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Efforts of the Edo State Government to grow her rubber stock and boost her non-oil receipts with the 2,500-hectare rubber plantation in Urhonigbe, in Orhionmwon Local Government Area and other agricultural initiatives, have received the support of the Federal Government.<br /><br />Rubber tree Speaking at a National Workshop on “Repositioning Nigeria Rubber for Competitiveness,” organised by the Nigeria Export Promotion Council (NEPC), in Benin City, the Edo State capital, Executive Director, NEPC, Olusegun Awolowo, said the workshop was organised to create a synergy among rubber processors, producers and exporters in Edo State and provide them with a platform to deliberate on how local investors can benefit from competing in the international market. Awolowo who was represented by Samuel Oyedipo, said that local farmers have a lot to benefit from rubber cultivation and production.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NOqPfU-1OBI/WrYJaqedj-I/AAAAAAAABSI/iXtVMkmt-5QYyg7W3NqtYJNyDX8sh06pgCLcBGAs/s1600/Rubber%2BTree.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"251\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"194\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NOqPfU-1OBI/WrYJaqedj-I/AAAAAAAABSI/iXtVMkmt-5QYyg7W3NqtYJNyDX8sh06pgCLcBGAs/s320/Rubber%2BTree.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“Nigeria’s current production is estimated at 127,000 metric tons annually. This makes us the largest producers in Africa and seventh globally after others, including Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. Export earnings from rubber cultivation and production annually stand at $37 million.” Awolowo added that Edo was reputed as the largest producer of natural rubber in Nigeria in the past and was famous for processing and marketing rubber in West Africa.<br /><br />&nbsp;He said, “If farmers improve their activities to grow rubber using improved seedlings, they stand to benefit more. NEPC is ready to intervene by providing farmers with 5,000 rubber seedlings.”<br /><br />In his response, the Governor of Edo State, Mr Godwin Obaseki, who was represented by his Special Adviser on Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security Programme, Mr. Joseph Okojie, noted, “As parts of the plans by the state government to revive rubber cultivation, we are partnering with the Federal Government to encourage the cultivation of rubber plantation.”<br /><br />&nbsp;“This workshop is timely as rubber cultivation and production which serve as a major source of revenue in past was neglected for crude oil.<br /><br />We have identified the need to improve rubber production to grow the economy, create prosperity for our people and reclaim its pride of place.” “We intend to create employment and increase our revenue drive through rubber cultivation and production.<br /><br />We are aligning with the Federal Government’s intent to revive rubber cultivation in Nigeria and have committed 2,500 hectares of land for rubber,” Obaseki added. Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, Mr. Monday Osaigbovo said, “A 2,500-hectare rubber plantation has been cultivated by the Edo State Government at Urhonigbe.<br /><br />It is part of Governor Obaseki-led administration’s agricultural initiatives to grow the non-oil sector and contribute to country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).”<br /><br /><b>Source: Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Boosting Sugar Cane Farming to Create Jobs",
    "content": "<br />Sunti Golden Sugar Estate in Mokwa, Niger State is poised to change the narrative in sugarcane farming.The estate comprises 17,000 hectares of arable farmland and a mill capable of processing 100,000 tonnes of raw sugar yearly, DANIEL ESSIET reports.<br /><br />Nigeria is one of the major producers of sugarcane in Africa, with about 500,000 hectares of land which can produce about five million metric tonnes (mt) of sugarcane.<br /><br />According to&nbsp; the National Sugar Development Council (NSDC), the five million metric&nbsp; tonnes (Mt) of sugarcane will yield about three million mt of sugar if processed.<br /><br />However, despite the country’s potential in sugar production for local consumption, its reliance on importation has become worrisome as it produces only two per cent of its sugar requirement. Nigeria imports about 1.7 million tonnes of sugar, up from 1.3 million tonnes in 2016.<br /><br />To address this, there have been various private sector efforts to encourage increase in acreage and cultivation.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jOvXZgL2juA/WrT1u-xuBiI/AAAAAAAABR4/2cWgetAph1w5fkytq0jzKv-FkTA4pHDLwCLcBGAs/s1600/Sunti-estate.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jOvXZgL2juA/WrT1u-xuBiI/AAAAAAAABR4/2cWgetAph1w5fkytq0jzKv-FkTA4pHDLwCLcBGAs/s320/Sunti-estate.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />It was against this backdrop that the sleepy town of Mokwa in Niger State witnessed the inauguration of the Sunti Golden Sugar Estates Limited, a subsidiary of Flour Mills of Nigeria (FMN ), by President Muhammadu Buhari.<br /><br />According to Buhari, the N50&nbsp; billion estate will produce 100,000 tonnes of high quality raw sugar annually to feed Flour Mills Sugar Refinery.<br /><br />His words: “While we have had some challenges in the implementation of the National Sugar Master Plan (NSMP) in the past, I believe that our vision of attaining self-sufficiency in sugar in Nigeria is well within sight, with the kind of investment that has been made here. I am told that the Estate will engage up to 10,000 people directly once developed, including a network of over 3,000 small-scale outgrowers of sugarcane. This to my mind is central to this administration’s determination to create jobs and gainfully engage our people.”<br /><br />Niger State Governor Alhaji Abubakar Sani Bello said the&nbsp; decision by Flour Mills to set up a sugarcane plantation in Sunti was the kind of step the state&nbsp; needed to actualise its quest to boost agriculture. The investment, according to him,&nbsp; is also an evidence of the unexploited potential in the sector.<br /><br />Such ventures, he stressed,&nbsp; are needed and the plantation in particular in Niger State is timely, especially when the overnment is working towards developing a sustainable, diversified and competitive agricultural sector to ensure greater economic stability and growth.<br /><br />He&nbsp; added that the state was interested in ensuring that more investors established enterprises to create jobs to improve people’s livelihood.<br /><br />Bello said: “For a long time now, lack of infrastructure has been one of the major hindrances to investment in agriculture. To this end, the government is working&nbsp; to support infrastructure across the state.”<br /><br />He said while the state appreciated and welcomed investors as partners in development, it expected&nbsp; them&nbsp; to take part by investing in agriculture and helping to grow the economy and eradicate poverty.<br /><br />“Niger people are proud farmers. For many years, we have cultivated rice, sorghum, millet, cowpeas, corn (maize), palm oil and kernels, kola nuts and sugarcane for local consumption and export. To this end, agriculture has always been a top priority for our state and will always receive our utmost support.<br /><br />“When we declared 2018 as the year of ‘Agricultural revolution,’ in Niger State, it was a reminder to our people of the immense natural resources that we have been blessed with. And that is why projects such as&nbsp; the Sunti Sugar Estate are a perfect model for investment in our state. From my last visit to Sunti Golden Sugar Estates in 2016 to date, I must say that I am delighted with the level of work and investment that has been put into this project,” Bello said.<br /><br />Flour Mills Chairman Mr. John Coumantaros said: “The farm at peak production will provide direct employment for about 10,000 people yearly, and impact up to 50,000 people indirectly, including 3,000 small-scale outgrowers, who will be cultivating sugar cane to feed the mill.<br /><br />“The project illustrates the desire to reduce sugar importation, save billions in foreign exchange, boost local capacity and reduce unemployment by putting thousands of Nigerians to work,” he said.<br /><br />He thanked the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), the Bank of Industry (BoI), the Ministries of Finance, Industry, Trade and Investment and Agriculture for their support for the project, adding that “a project of this nature could never have taken place without the staunch support of Mr President and the Niger State Governor.”<br /><br />He said N50 billion had been invested in the Sunti Golden Sugar Estate. The company, he said, has significantly invested in food and agro-allied value chains to align with the government’s agricultural initiatives.<br /><br />Flour Mills, he explained, is determined to ensure the success of agro-allied investments through maximising local content in the company’s final products while it remains committed to its policy of being involved at all stages of the food value chain: from farm to table.<br /><br />Enclosed within a 35-kilometre dyke, the production facility area is about 17,000 hectares, with a cane area of a maximum output of 10,000 hectares.<br /><br />The estate features the state-of-the-art irrigation system that will ensure efficient cultivation of sugar cane, with infrastructure, which includes drain pumps, pump stations and power grid.<br /><br />Drains, culverts and flood-protection walls have also been constructed. The state-of-the art operations bring new technology to the sugar cane farming and milling industry that is poised to increase production yield, create new jobs for Nigerians and teach them new skills. Currently, sugar cane is grown on 3,000 hectares and cultivated under irrigation, making it an annual crop, with 276 hectare (ha) furrow, 700ha pivot and the balance under sprinkler irrigation.<br /><br />It is harvested by hand and transported by road to the factory using haulage tractors to pull a pair of tandem trailers with a capacity for 30 tonnes of cane.<br /><br />The estate has brought infrastructure benefits to the surrounding community, with 28 communities taking advantage of the new 30-kilometre road plus expansive road networks, which provide a variety of access routes to indigenes’ homes.<br /><br />At the farm, smart agriculture is helping the company increase crop yield,optimise workers and machines performance .<br /><br />Processing will ensure every part of the cane is used.<br /><br />As a result of the steady demand for skilled workers, which will grow, Niger State will draw labour&nbsp; from other states, and provide training for local workers.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Stop Exporting Raw Materials, Agric Experts advise Farmers",
    "content": "<br />Agricultural experts have advised farmers to stop exporting raw materials, but rather add value to the products to generate higher revenue.<br /><br />The Chief Executive Officer, Best Foods Global Limited, Dr. Emmanuel Ijewere, said farming only accounted for about 20 per cent of activities in the agribusiness sector, while value addition and other value chain activities were responsible for the remaining 80 per cent.<br /><br />He explained that the cashew being produced in Nigeria and exported at a meagre sum was merely roasted in Vietnam and sold for a higher price.<br /><br />He stated that the difference in unit prices was about $20, adding that if Nigerians had taken the pain to ‘roast it’, they would have realised higher revenue.<br /><br />While speaking at the Moringa Export Launch in Lagos, Ijewere noted that Nigeria was poor by choice.<br /><br />According to him, Nigeria is blessed with resources needed to grow, process agricultural produce, earn good revenue and enrich the populace.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q24h3PDE9T8/WeHXaM1F90I/AAAAAAAAAXw/7Y5Z5kkKElc2spbCVfjv_RPbRRg3XMI1wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/cassava.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"435\" data-original-width=\"696\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Q24h3PDE9T8/WeHXaM1F90I/AAAAAAAAAXw/7Y5Z5kkKElc2spbCVfjv_RPbRRg3XMI1wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/cassava.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said Nigerians spent time on things not available in the country, rather than concentrate on available resources to make a living.<br /><br />“Nigeria is poor by choice. We have an untapped multi-trillion naira agribusiness economy. All we have to do is focus on value addition before exportation. However, the focus should not be on exportation only. There should be a balance between production for exportation and production for local consumption,” Ijewere stated.<br /><br />He added that there were a lot of untapped resources in Nigeria.<br /><br />Speaking further, he said the Moringa economy was fast developing, while urging farmers to tap into this to generate income.<br /><br />Speaking at the event, the Chief Executive Officer, Dawacom international Limited, Mr. Sontonye Anga, said Moringa had great export potential that would generate revenue at a geometric progression if invested in.<br /><br />Anga said as a farmer, he was going to invest in the Moringa business to build wealth for Nigerians, and urged other farmers to do same in order to create a formidable and massive economy.<br /><br />He said aside from the wealth benefits of investing in Moringa, the product had other health benefits that would be useful in curing sicknesses common to Nigerians.<br /><br />“Experts in the agricultural sector will make sure the Moringa economy becomes real with specific targets realisable within the next one year,” Anga stated.<br /><br /><b>By: Feyisayo Popoola</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "FG Targets 17 million Rice Farmers This Year",
    "content": "<br />The number of rice farmers in Nigeria is currently being increased by five million people in order to enhance rice cultivation across the country, the Federal Government has announced.<br /><br />It said although rice farmers in Nigeria increased from five million to 12 million in the past two years, it was important to attract more people into the business so as to attain sufficiency in rice production.<br /><br />The Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed, who disclosed this during a tour of some rice farms, stated that the government had commenced the cultivation of rice on additional 200,000 hectares of land in different states across the country.<br /><br />He stated that 25 farmers would cultivate the crop on each hectare, adding that a total of five million farmers would be needed to work on the 200,000 hectares of farmland.<br /><br />Mohammed further explained that the initiative had commenced in Kano, where 31,000 farmers had been engaged by the Central Bank of Nigeria through the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme.<br /><br />He said, “We’ve grown the number of rice farmers from five million two years ago to over 12 million today. And there is a pilot scheme going on this season again with 200,000 hectares for the cultivation of rice. Now, each hectare employs 25 people; so that will have another five million people that will be added to the rice revolution.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-waRaivykRtY/WdY-7C60N3I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/Zzq6TSTNh_Y3xRnk989Zv7q5Ap_J-UfJgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-waRaivykRtY/WdY-7C60N3I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/Zzq6TSTNh_Y3xRnk989Zv7q5Ap_J-UfJgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Rice.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“We want to make Nigeria self-sufficient in rice production and the fact that we are now growing the number of our farmers and we are reducing importation means that we are gradually getting to our target of self-sufficiency in food production.<br /><br />“The cultivation of rice on 200,000 hectares has been flagged off and right now, about 31,000 farmers are being empowered by the CBN under this initiative in Kano this season.”<br /><br />Mohammed stated that aside from Kebbi State, one of the most popular states involved the project, 31 other states were already planting rice in commercial quantity.<br /><br />“There are 32 states producing rice in Nigeria and the same model is being used, which is the CBN Anchor Borrowers programme. This programme provides the farmers with seedlings, farm inputs, extension and advisory services, among others. And we can see the result of this programme,” he said.<br /><br />The minister reiterated that Thailand had commenced moves to establish rice mills in Nigeria, encouraged by the increasing number of farmers and states involved in rice production in the country.<br /><br />He said the Federal Government had won its fight against rice importation, especially from Thailand, as Nigeria had reduced its importation of rice by over 90 per cent.<br /><br />“As we speak today, Thailand rice growers are making passionate appeal to the Federal Government. What they are doing now is that they want to set up rice mills in Nigeria, which means we have won,” Mohammed stated.<br /><br />When asked again to explain why Thailand rice producers were pushing to set up mills in Nigeria, Mohammed said, “Thailand wants to set up several rice mills in Nigeria because we have stopped importing from them.”<br /><br />He stated that Nigeria was able to cut down on the importation of rice from Thailand from 644,000 metric tonnes two years ago to a little over 20,000MT currently.<br /><br />Mohammed particularly lauded the Kebbi State Government as he noted that the state was pushing the country’s rice revolution to greater heights.<br /><br />Speaking alongside the information minister, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Kebbi State, Mohammed Dandiga, said over 200,000 farmers were involved in the cultivation of rice across the 16 local government areas in the state.<br /><br />He said Kebbi had attained self-sufficiency in rice production and was already supplying the commodity in large quantity to other states of the federation.<br /><br />Dandiga noted that between December 2015 and March 2018, the volume of rice from Kebbi State has grown from 2.5 metric tonnes per hectare to 11 metric tonnes per hectare.<br /><br />He said, “For us, this is something very important, considering the impact which it has on wealth creation for these farmers, particularly since the past two years. We are working hard to increase the participation of others who are interested in agriculture because we now have off-takers.<br /><br />“Nigerian rice is now the preferred choice, unlike what it used to be in the past and this is because we now have standard rice mills in Kebbi and some other parts of the country.”<br /><br />The President, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Aminu Goronyo, recently stated that Nigerians consumed about 7.9 million tonnes of rice in 2017, with the country’s local farmers producing 5.8 million tonnes last year.<br /><br />Out of this local production, Kebbi State accounted for about one million tonnes last year.<br /><br />The state government recently stated that with greater investment, especially from the CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme and better access to farm inputs, Kebbi planned to raise its rice production to 2.5 million metric tonnes in 2018. Rice is grown mainly in 16, out of the 21 local government areas in Kebbi State.<br /><br />In August 2017, Vice-President Yemi Osinbajo inaugurated a N10bn rice mill in Argungu, Kebbi State, with a milling capacity of 500,000 tonnes.<br /><br />The Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Bagudu, recently announced that the 200,000 farmers in his state were growing rice on over 400,000 hectares.<br /><br />He said, “It is heart-warming for us to know that we are able to create wealth for rice farmers and that as a result of the production of rice in Kebbi, Nigeria has been able to reduce its importation of rice by over 90 per cent.<br /><br />“This is good news and it shows that a lot of people not just in Kebbi State are now producing rice and very soon, we will start exporting the commodity. In Kebbi, there are farmers who are under the Central Bank of Nigeria Anchor Borrowers programme.<br /><br />“We also have those who work for private companies. A large number of farmers numbering about 200,000 are into rice production in our state and they now cultivate on not less than 400,000 hectares of land across the state.”<br /><br /><b>By: Okechukwu Nnodim,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The demand for animal products presents many income opportunities. This is critical because livestock production will become the biggest contributor to agriculture in the coming decades, with consumption of animal-based foods becoming the fastest growing sub-food category in Africa.<br /><br />&nbsp;The main challenge now is determining how to intensify livestock productivity in a sustainable manner. Today, guinea pig farming business is gaining popularity throughout the world. Farmers should try raising guinea pigs for health and wealth as the demand is becoming huge both at the local and the export market.<br /><br />Guinea pig, small livestock with big potential, can be raised to improve the nutrition and livelihoods of farmers by providing food and additional income.<br /><br />Guinea pigs need little space to grow. The little creature with big potential does not require much capital to rear. Farmers just need a modicum of about N20,000 to start after securing space for them.<br /><br />Guinea pig farming business is a more profitable source of food and income than many traditional stock animals as they require much less room than traditional livestock and they reproduce extremely quickly.<br /><br />Apart from economic benefits, the animal also has health benefits. Guinea pig meat is white, lean, tasty and healthy for consumption, in addition to being wholesome and delicious. It has a protein content of about 21 per cent, which is higher than the protein content of poultry, pork or beef.

They are not pigs nor do they come from Guinea or Guinea-Bissau. They originated in the Andes. Half of the mammals in the world are rodents.<br /><br />The order is so huge that it had to be divided into suborders: Sciuromorpha-squirrel-like rodents, Myomorpha-mouse-like rodents and Caviomorpha-cavy-like rodents. Guinea pigs are cavy type rodents, they are warm blooded mammals.<br /><br />Like most cavies, guinea pig has short legs, a short neck, a big head and no tail. The life expectancy is about four to eight years while their size in length is about 10 inches; height, five to six inches and weight is about two pounds.<br /><br />The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Jovana Integrated Farms, Prince Arinze Onebunne, said the demand for quality guinea pig meat has been increasing yearly because of the growing awareness of their nutritional benefits, especially among health-conscious people.<br /><br />He added that the production of guinea pigs gives small farmers a chance to increase their income and health, and offers an alternative means of livelihood to urban and rural farmers. He said that raising the animal is another way to earn extra income and also a ready meal for the family whenever they want to take a protein rich meal without any side effect.<br /><br />He explained: “Guinea pig farming is an occupation that can enhance food security and employment creation. It is a productive enterprise since it can be reared in a small floor space. They are clean small animals and are odourless and keeping them is cost-effective. They can be kept in cages, corridors, passages, kitchens or any available space in the house.”<br /><br />According to him, the guinea pig is able to breed year-round, with as many as five litters a year, the gestation period lasting nine weeks. He stated that unlike rabbit and dog, guinea pigs are born with fur and their eyes open.<br /><br />Explaining further, he said, “they look like miniature versions of their parents when they are born. They nurse right away and will even start eating solid food two to three days after they are born. However, they will nurse for three to four weeks and usually have litters of four to five young at a go. Sexual maturity is reached at about 60-70 days. A young guinea pig can run when it is only three hours old.<br /><br />“Other than the greens or kitchen wastes, which include potatoes, yam and cassava pellets, guinea pig can be fed with maize flour, supplement and water. At Jovana Farms, we breed and sell guinea pigs. The animals are paired two males to six females. And a set of two males and six females are sold for N20,000,” he explained.<br /><br />He said guinea pigs are farmed for their healthy meat and are often used for medical research, noting, that is where people get the term “guinea pig” to describe somebody who volunteers to go first.<br /><br />He encouraged farmers to look inwards and focus on the neglected but vital sources of animal protein for household diets, export and employment generation.<br /><br />He said Jovana is embarking on a nationwide agro-seminar intended to provide useful information, create awareness and motivate Nigerians to get involved in animal farming ventures.<br /><br />Said he: “I keep telling people that there are so many opportunities here in this country. But it’s sad that many of our youths are out there waiting for miracle to happen from nowhere. Prayer indeed is good, but while calling on the gods, a man should himself lend a hand.”<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Ranches, Regulated Cattle Market, Solution to Herdsmen crisis –Osijo, Veterinary Doctor and Systems Development Expert",
    "content": "&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />The Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, RBS Consulting Ltd., Dr. Aderemi Osijo, who is a veterinary doctor, speaks on an alternative solution to the herdsmen crisis in the country in this interview with TUNDE AJAJA<br /><br /><b>In your view, how did Nigeria get to this level of escalated killings by suspected herdsmen?</b><br /><br />I think the crisis we have is because the government has not played the role it’s supposed to play, in terms of regulating the market, and basically, the crisis is not necessarily an ethnic issue, though it presents itself as such, but it’s deeper than that. It is what I would call a crisis driven by the need for preservation of wealth. In the south, people accumulate wealth in terms of properties, bond, shares, cash, etc., but a typical Fulani or Hausa man keeps his wealth in the numbers of herds of cattle that he has. And one way they preserve the value of that wealth is to graze them. Due to the pressure on land and very little area left for grazing, a typical Fulani man would want to keep large number of animals that are well fattened, but he is not ready to do what is necessary to keep them, and he’s not ready to put in additional investment in terms of ranching, so he goes about grazing. That is how we got here, and for me, instead of seeing conflict, I am seeing economic opportunities.<br /><br /><b>What are those opportunities?</b><br /><br />The Fulani goes about grazing his animals on an open field or cultivated areas to maintain or add value to his wealth, but no sooner those animals are well fed through grazing that they lose the weight and excess energy they have accumulated to trekking. So, most often than not, they are not maintaining anything and that is basically out of ignorance. While we come in with legislation (anti-open grazing law) that even makes the situation a bit more difficult, that law has to be complemented by other measures which help the Fulani to see the need for investment in ranching, and that is my hypothesis. The solution to this problem is the regulation of the cattle market and I believe that all over the world, nobody sells items that are not traceable, else, it becomes an adulterated market, which becomes a recipe for disaster, and that is basically what is happening.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UK9b1espxMw/Wq0U3o-UnAI/AAAAAAAABQQ/ci2TMWuQADw3E8ULnESOXW1MM1fmS4_egCLcBGAs/s1600/Dr%2BAderemi%2BOsijo%2BVet.PNG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"451\" data-original-width=\"734\" height=\"196\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UK9b1espxMw/Wq0U3o-UnAI/AAAAAAAABQQ/ci2TMWuQADw3E8ULnESOXW1MM1fmS4_egCLcBGAs/s320/Dr%2BAderemi%2BOsijo%2BVet.PNG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><b>What solution are you proposing?</b><br /><br />It’s a very simple one. In order for you to sell cattle in a particular state, there must be grading of those animals through a standard quality measurement parameter. This should be in the scale of the best to the worst, so people are not just buying blindly; they are buying based on the weight, nutritive value and other considerations and it would be done by the state government. Also, there would be a law that makes it mandatory that every cattle coming in to be traded in a state must be traded within a cattle market, which should be an auction market, and the auctioneers must be registered and licensed by the government. So, you bring in your cattle, your cattle are graded based on whatever criteria that have been set, from good to bad and you sell it only in approved places. That grading system would also differentiate ranch-fed animals and open-grazed animals, which would not have the same quality. It would also discriminate against animals that were fed using steroids and other growth hormones, which could be injurious if not withdrawn on time. So, you have this grading system and these influence the categorisation and the pricing. It is going to encourage premium for prime animals, while you pay next to nothing for poor quality animals.<br /><br /><b>What guarantees us that categorisation would help?</b><br /><br />What would happen is that the people who have been selling poor quality animals for premium would realise that the market is not there and that the animals are being discounted because of what they look like; underfed, stressed, diseased or appear to be on steroids or growth hormones, and no one would pay for it. So, people would know that it is a market that discriminates based on quality and value. The Fulani man who grazes his animals all the way from Chad or Sahel would realise that with all his efforts, people would only pay little for the animal, whereas the one that is fed in a ranch would look fattened and command good price. That would compel them to take a look at what others are doing right that they are not doing and then they would see the need to start investing in ranches. It would also occur to them that the animals they are grazing across the Sahel down to the southern part of the country are animals that are tough and cannot meet the prime quality that people are looking for. Nobody would tell them to change their approach.<br /><br /><b>One could presume that these herdsmen do not have the resources or financial strength to establish ranches. Isn’t that a concern?</b><br /><br />The original owners of those animals who are usually the big elite among the ruling class would be the ones to put money into the ranches. It takes a minimum of five years to get an animal from birth to about 1,000kg market weight, but for the same animal under a feed lot situation, you can make it between one and half years and two years. So, why do you want to keep delaying your return for five years when you can get it in two years under intensive management. What that would lead to is that the demand for animals grazed in the open field would suddenly decline. Currently, the way it is being done is totally unsustainable and it is just simply going to tear this country apart if we don’t start addressing the issue. But I see a lot of business opportunities arising from doing things this other way.<br /><br /><b>Given other uses land have What about the volume of land that would be required?</b><br /><br />It takes about 30 hectares of improved grazing land for a calf cow unit (a cow and its calf) to maintain them in a year. So, if you have millions of cows, it means all the land in Nigeria would have to become a grazing land and it just cannot happen that way because you need land for other things. So, under ranching and feed lot situation, you have a feed lot that can take thousands of animals. You need a lot of grains, hay and silage to feed those animals. What you need to do is to keep your ranch and grow grains and all other things right around you and after you have harvested it, you can make your silage and hay that can feed those animals for a whole year. So, instead of grazing on 30 hectares, that vast land, when well maintained, might probably maintain 100 herds. So, it is imperative that the government comes out to regulate the cattle industry, which would open up the need for investment in ranching. And when you start having feed lots and ranches, it simply means you need to grow the feed that you would require to maintain those animals off grazing. Also, there has to be laws in place to drive that process. It is those laws that are largely missing and because the laws are not there, that is provoking conflict, presenting itself as an ethnic conflict, whereas it is more about preservation of wealth.<br /><br /><b>What other economic opportunities are people likely to derive from this solution?</b><br /><br />As a consultant who has been working on market systems for years, what you would see is that as people invest in ranches and feed lots, there would be the need for them to grow fodders to keep their animals well fed and that means the sorghum value chain and maize value chain would automatically respond to that market demand. So, the grains value chain becomes even a bigger one. Instead of just growing maize for human and chicken consumption and perhaps for the breweries, you now have additional demand for cattle. What you now have in this cereal grain value chain is that you grow your corn, sorghum, millet, harvest the grains and what is left is what you turn into your hay or silage for the cattle. So, it is the by-product from those agronomic activities that you are using to enhance your wealth which you have kept in the cattle. Also, you can grow all those things and turn them into silage that you can feed to those animals. Imagine a man who eats and sleeps at the same place; he’s not going out to do anything. What happens? He starts to increase in size. The same thing would happen to those animals; because you have restricted their movement and they are not using that energy they could use in building muscles to trek, they build muscles much faster and you have better yield. What you need from those animals is their muscles – beef – not the trekking. Before, we were not giving chickens grains; we made them free-range chickens, but what happened when we started having domesticated poultry farm, there was increased demand for grains and farmers responded to that challenge. The same thing would happen in this situation. That is one opportunity. It can also lead to what I would call small holding ranches or feed lots. The government needs to come up with policies that tend to encourage farmers who are growing grains to also maintain cattle, The beauty of it all is that, by the time you start having commercial ranches and feed lots, you would have so many animals that are well fed, of good quality and disease-free beef, with good quality hides and then you now sell them in a regulated market.<br /><br /><b>What if they are not sold on time?</b><br /><br />If you have animals that are due for slaughter and you don’t sell and they continue to eat, you are just wasting money and you are losing. So, people who are running those ranches could easily sell them to abattoirs at good prices and they could put them in the cold room for preservation, with their values maintained. We also encourage the state government to regulate their cattle transaction market and the sale of beef in the open market. If you are going to sell beef, it has to be packed and frozen. Then, we can also generate foreign exchange by selling them as cattle or in various processed forms, because most of the meat you see here were smuggled from Botswana, which is the largest cattle industry in the entire Africa. It’s their major foreign exchange earner; it’s a well organised industry and they are Africans like us. There are some business models we can copy from them and there are laws we can adopt with slight modification. Let us copy what works and not stick to what has failed. What has failed is open grazing and the nomadic method.<br /><br /><b>Is the system in Botswana akin to this solution you have proffered?</b><br /><br />Very well, and wherever you find major countries that export beef, say Argentina, Brazil, United States, take a look at their laws and you find that it’s not like the way we do it here. Of course, countries like America have gone through this type of issue in those good old days, so it’s a passing phase in our lives, but we can do better. I want to assume too that the Fulani are not particularly interested in this current crisis because you can’t sell your products to the dead or in a market where there is conflict or where they don’t want you. So, it’s a very complex situation, but with a little bit of tact, we can solve this problem. The intervention cannot be directed at the herdsmen; it has to be directed at the original owners, I mean the Nigerian or northern elite. If the government works with the private sector and international partners, people would start pumping resources into that area until it gets saturated. I think what we are having here is an issue of ignorance on the part of the government, forgetting that there is so much money they can make from the chain, like licensing auctioneers, taking taxes from the people who come to buy and sell and the people who run the transportation. When you have an under-regulated market, this is the kind of chaos you would always have.<br /><br /><b>It seems that it requires a collective effort, but are Nigerians to blame for the ignorance of these herdsmen who should know how to preserve their wealth?</b><br /><br />Certainly, we cannot be blamed for their ignorance, but we have to blame ourselves for perpetuating that ignorance. How? We create the market for bad quality products. Whenever there is demand, you would continue to have all these poor quality products. You know that an unregulated market is a recipe for economic disaster. The only reason why this nation is the way it is now is due to the dysfunctionality of our business regulatory environment. So, when the nomad finds out that his cattle, despite trekking several kilometres, commands little value, they would do things right. Anytime you kill somebody or there is a conflict, it is making your business ugly, painting a bad image of your ethnic group and making the possibility of transacting a business with you extremely more dangerous. But, out of this sad situation is tremendous business investment and wealth opportunities that can even take a lot of our people out of the street.<br /><br /><b>In terms of the grading and looking at how standards measurement have failed in running abattoirs, how can we be sure of an effective system where only the best are rated as such and there would be no compromise?</b><br /><b><br /></b>It’s very simple; use of technology. How do you do it? You create a grading mechanism; you have pictures of animals that go for what we call utility animals, that is the poorest one, and the best which is called the prime bull, and you see the pictures of the three other grades that are in-between. So, immediately somebody brings in a truckload of cattle or treks them down to the place where they would be sold, before you go in, you have to pay a certain sum, and you cannot sell live cattle anywhere except that place, and if you do that, you go to jail and your cattle confiscated. I’m not saying there would be no foul play, there would be but the people who are going to grade it are certified professionals who are licensed. Once you, as a licensed professional, is found wanting, not only will your licence be withdrawn, you would be sentenced to jail for endangering the lives of the people. It’s as simple as that. So, if you grade a utility animal as prime and there are cameras monitoring things, somebody would ask questions. You would always have foul play in every human environment but there would be sanctions in place.<br /><br /><b>Can we say all the states in Nigeria have sufficient land to accommodate this model?</b><br /><br />All of them have, but the question is how intensive or extensive in terms of quantity are we looking at. If you have a 50 cow calf ranch, it is still a ranch, which is an enclosed paddock where you raise animals. So, if a man decides to buy 100 hectares of land and he wants to fence it with barb wires to keep the animals safe, that is still a ranch. It doesn’t have to be owned by the government. All they need to do is to regulate it. What they equally need to do is to allocate land, because you can’t use agronomic land for grazing, that is absolute waste of money; you graze land that are not productive. So, it is not a matter of land. The land is there. A state that may not be able to do what is called intensive cattle operation may become a state that grows so much of plant, hay or grasses that can be processed into hay or silage that can be sold to others. In a place like Sokoto, Kebbi, Kano where there is extensive land and they don’t even know what to do with it, they can accommodate for as many animals as they want. Even in the South-West, there is a particular breed of cattle that is indigenous, called West African Indama cattle or Kete or Orunla. They are short but very fantastic meat. I cannot see any state telling me I cannot have a ranch in my state. The state government may not have enough land to give for ranching, but if I’m able to buy the land, which I’m supposed to, you cannot tell me not to do cattle ranching on my land, provided it is within the agricultural zone under the land use decree. If I have money, I may decide to have a ranch. I would buy utility animals from those coming from the North, put them in the ranch and in six months, they are looking completely different and I would sell them at a higher value. These are business opportunities.<br /><br /><b>It would seem the herdsmen are used to roaming…</b><br /><br />(Cuts in…) They are not used to roaming; condition has made them to roam because they don’t have alternatives. That aside, the owners of the herds should do the ranches because the herdsmen you see are just like cowboys; they are not the owners. It is the owner that is going to be losing money, selling utility animals instead of prime animals. So, when he finds out that his wealth is being diminished due to legislation and enforcement, nobody would tell him before he starts to invest in the right thing. If he does not do it, maybe a middleman can come in and those middlemen are people like you and me. So, if you regulate that market and you grade those animals, there would be value for money. This model is workable. I’m a veterinarian; I studied animal and veterinary sciences; I studied in the United States and I have worked in large, I mean large feed lots, where we have feed lots of animals coming in and we sold nothing less than 3,000 herds daily. Here, it is more about the failure of our regulatory system and I hate to say that we have a completely hopeless governance system in this country. There are no thinkers, but people who are just basically looking for money without being ready to contribute anything. This solution is rudimentary economics.<br /><br /><b>Between the cattle that were fed through grazing and those fed through ranching, which is better?</b><br /><br />I will, at anytime, go for a ranch-fed animal because it is tender, tastier and the nutritional value is equally there. A grass-fed animal cannot be of the same grade with a feedlot-fed animal. It’s almost impossible. The meat of a grass-fed animal is tougher than the tenderness and the juicy type that you get from a ranch-fed animal. The only thing you see in a grass-fed animal is that it takes a much longer time for its meat to become developed and as it is getting developed, it’s getting tougher.<br /><br /><b>If this model is adopted, how long before the outcome can be felt?</b><br /><br />If we put in place these laws, in the immediate, you would need to train and certify market operators and regulators. So we need to develop curriculum, modules and certification process under the law. You have to start looking at developing what we call the cattle market, which is like an open field, where you would have paddocks and where people can bid. Those infrastructure need to be there. So, as you are doing all these, that is immediate and that would take one to two years. But as you are building that, you create a massive public awareness and you are also sensitising people about this law that would come into effect soon. So, you are basically preparing their mind, which is about attitudinal changes that need to take place. By the third year, you want to say at least 50 per cent of cattle sold in that area must be through a particular channel. By the fourth year, you can move to 60 per cent and by fifth or sixth year, you are on 100 per cent. So, I’m looking at a project that could take a 10-year span for you to see the economic impact, but you need to start from somewhere and it is that starting point that needs to be well refined. I have done a lot on market systems development and value chain intervention, but debate can be generated around this. The solution is not by building ranches for them or setting up cattle colonies. What we are doing with cattle colonies is reinforcing negative attitude because it would get to a point when the carrying capacity of those colonies would be too limited. They would not maintain those grazing fields. If you have a cattle colony meant for 100 animals and you continue to graze it relentlessly, even up to the point that these animals graze it right into the root, then the place would become barren and they would start looking for where else to go, and then what you have done is that you have destroyed that vegetation. So, it goes far beyond creating cattle colonies.<br /><br /><b>By: Aderemi Osijo</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Managing Director of AA Universal Agro Industries, Mr. Chris Agara, has said the massive involvement of youths in developing the agricultural sector, especially in the area of rice and cocoa production in Cross River State, will address youth restiveness.<br /><br />He said the drive, which would bring about empowerment of youths, could be achieved through the introduction of schemes that will attract the youths.<br /><br />Agara, who spoke through a former governorship candidate of the defunct Peoples Progressive Alliance in the 2011 general election, Mr. Goddy Akpama, said the influx of youths into the agricultural sector would change the economic fortune of the state.<br /><br />Citing the fast rate at which the country’s population was increasing, he said agriculture was the only way to go in order to ensure food sufficiency in the state and Nigeria in the nearest future.<br /><br />Precisely, Akpama said that the geometric progression of the population of Cross River State would have reached three million at the moment, adding that there was the immediate need to look away from oil and focus critically on farming.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UkrGxrq5SHY/WjurnFsFIvI/AAAAAAAAA9s/g9h-OZeotHYUO-Eyp97YEouEUx_TIIh_gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Wheat.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UkrGxrq5SHY/WjurnFsFIvI/AAAAAAAAA9s/g9h-OZeotHYUO-Eyp97YEouEUx_TIIh_gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Wheat.jpg\" /></a></div><br />He said, “In relative terms, the population of Cross River State based on the 2006 population census figure was 2.88 million.

If the business is taken seriously, they could expand and become large employers of labour.”<br /><br />“The last training focused on fish processing; this training would focus on production. Unlike the last set where we had more females, this set has more males. We are always happy to train women because naturally, they are skilled at food processing and production. So, we want to update their skills to follow modern technology,” Anyanwu said.<br /><br />She added that the institute was putting in place mentorship programmes for each trainee, so they could learn from their mentors.<br /><br />According to her, the success stories of previous training motivated the senators and members of the House of Representatives to venture into sponsoring members from their constituencies to learn.<br /><br />She said if corporate organisations could sponsor people to learn a skill in agriculture, the government could do same or even better.<br /><br /><b>By: Feyisayo Popoola</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Cost of Rice Production in States Surged in 2yrs",
    "content": "<br />The cost of rice production went up significantly in the last two years, a recent survey released by the Federal Government has shown.<br /><br />The year 2016 was a difficult one for farmers because of the high cost of inputs like fertilizer, which sold as high as N12,000 per bag in some places. This is said to be due to government’s restriction on the sale of urea fertilizer, a basic ingredient for making explosives by insurgents in the North East.<br /><br />The situation left many farmers unable to buy the product in most parts of the North, which is the largest consumer of fertiliser.<br /><br />Although the year was goodfor farmers in the country as they got good prices for their produce, the cost involved in every aspect of production nullified that gain. This is also worsened by the weakened value of the naira against the dollar as a result of the economic recession.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Heineken Lokpobiri, unveiled for the first time in 30 years, the National Agricultural Performance Survey for the 2017 wet season in Nigeria.<br /><br />The survey was done by the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS) Ahmadu Bello University, in collaboration with the Federal Department of Agriculture and the Federal Department of Extension Services.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-16v652mN1Tg/WqpVKkSbo7I/AAAAAAAABPk/R0Q0skXR3tA59adp7uY4MSjF_JkBcUmBwCLcBGAs/s1600/Cost%2Bof%2BProduction.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-16v652mN1Tg/WqpVKkSbo7I/AAAAAAAABPk/R0Q0skXR3tA59adp7uY4MSjF_JkBcUmBwCLcBGAs/s320/Cost%2Bof%2BProduction.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The report has presented a lot of data regarding the various subsectors of the nation’s agriculture which were hitherto inaccessible to the general public.<br /><br />The National Agricultural Performance Survey for rice compares the cost of production in 2016 to 2017 thus: “The 2017 wet season survey showed that the estimated cropped area for rice was 3.90 hectares, which represented an increase of about 6.9 per cent over the 3.17 per cent hectares cultivated in 2016.<br /><br />“The increase in land area could be attributed to the Federal Government’s initiatives of reducing the large sums of money used for the importation of the crop and the intensification of the production of the crop in the country.<br /><br />“A total output of 8.02 million metric tonnes was recorded in 2017 as against the 6.99 million tonnes recorded in 2016, which indicated that the crop had recorded a significant increase in the output of about 14.7 per cent.<br /><br />However, the average yield of 2.4 per cent recorded is still far below global standard,” the report reads in part.<br /><br />While the quantum of rice production has increased in the country; thanks to good prices, import restriction and the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme of the Central Bank of Nigeria, the cost of production has gone up by more than 50 per cent in some states.<br /><br />For instance, Anambra State, which has the least cost for producing rice per hectare, recorded 40 per cent increase from N60,000&nbsp; in 2016 to N100,000 in 2017; whereas the cost in Abia and Ebonyi States rose from N280,000 and N300,000 respectively to N400,000.<br /><br />In 2016, the cost of major farm operations across the 36 states and the FCT indicated that ploughing a hectare was N16, 739.8, but was increased to N20, 196.4 in 2017, while harrowing rose from N14,265.6 to N17, 589.2 per hectare in 2017.<br /><br />An Agricultural Economist, Austin Bako, said the fall of the value of the naira against the dollar increased the prices of imported agro-machines and the raw materials for making fertilizer, chemicals and other inputs - something which he said also triggered the rise in the prices of these inputs.<br /><br />Mr. Bako said the country had over the years relied heavily on imported machines for farm operations without giving due attention to some of the indigenous technologies that were developed by our research institutes.<br /><br />Engineer James David of the National Centre for Agricultural Mechanisation (NCAM), in a chat, said the institute had large stock of indigenous technologies, which states government could leverage on for the benefit of their farmers.<br /><br />Engr. David stressed that Nigerian farmers who were mostly smallholders would benefit greatly from these cheap technologies at the institute located in Ilorin, the Kwara State capital.<br /><br />He said the institute could produce any machine that would increase the productivity of the farmers but noted that the politicians preferred to spend money heavily on imported ones.<br /><br />Experts believe if government embarks on a deliberate programme to develop local technologies, which are key for mechanised farming, it will increase the productivity of an average Nigerian farmer.&nbsp;<br /><br />Although, the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme seeks to remove the huge burden of cost from many rice farmers across the country, less than one million of the 12 million registered rice farmers accessed the funds, while many more millions of both registered and unregistered farmers are still struggling to benefit from the system.<br /><br />The CBN’s Anchor Borrowers’ Programme must be expanded massively along with some government financial intervention to ease this cost until the country recovers completely from the shock of the last recession. It remains the viable way farmers can expand production and increase their output across the rice value chain.&nbsp; <br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

Bananas should not be planted on water logged soils to prevent condition root rot disease.<br /><br />Also, banana trees should be spaced 1.8 metres by 1.5 metres. A point to note is that banana is a water loving plant and as such, an average rainfall of 700mm is good for the healthy vegetative growth of banana.<br /><br />For irrigated banana fields, the soil should be kept moist at all times, with sufficient water but not too much.<br /><br />Glyphosate pesticide should be sprayed at about 2 litres per unit hectare before planting, however manual weeding needs to be done to properly remove weeds.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

This gives the producer an opportunity to cultivate the maize variety he deems suitable for his production.<br /><br />“The problem of raising market price of the produce is curtailed as the producer has his maize in stock at a farm price all through his production circle,” Maikano said.<br /><br />He added that he generated revenue right from the farm by preserving and selling the maize stalks to cattle rearers in February and March, and that the proceeds and that of the maize chaff he sold are used in renting farmland for more cultivation.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E0JWHbSACWI/Wgwi3xLJKsI/AAAAAAAAAus/_5SX4p7OrpEY-c4Am0pcnT5Ns0CS_BgqACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Maize.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"256\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-E0JWHbSACWI/Wgwi3xLJKsI/AAAAAAAAAus/_5SX4p7OrpEY-c4Am0pcnT5Ns0CS_BgqACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Maize.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Maikano further said he packaged his products in 50kg and 25kg bags which he bought from Kano and print them in Kaduna as there was no printing press in Funtua and its environs.<br /><br />“We are selling our 50kg flour at N8,000 and the 25kg at N4,000, and we transport our products to far away Borno, Bauchi, Jigawa and Sokoto states.<br /><br />“We don’t take it to Kano for there are lots of competitors there,” he said.<br /><br />One of Maikano’s co-workers, Shamsu Mohammed, said there were at least 16 employees in Maikano’s industry; each partaking at a different staged of the flour production.<br /><br />“Four of us are in charge of the two grinding machines we are using. There are two others that take care of the carts for transporting the semi-finished products to the factory. 10 women are involved in removing chaff from the grains, soaking the grains, sieving, as well as sun-drying the finished flour before packaging,” Shamsu said.<br /><br />He added that the limited number of employees were always strictly charged to observe hygienic measures in the course of production.<br /><br />Another entrepreneur, Alhaji Salisu Sa’a Funtua, said despite the progress recorded in the business they still had some problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;“Irregular power supply tampers with our smooth production and high cost of petrol has been a challenge; especially in transporting our maize flour to various states,” he said.<br /><br />He further said lack of a formidable association had been a source of concern as they lacked capacity to speak with one voice, as well as adequately control the price mechanisms of their products.<br /><br />Daily Trust observed that households now preferred to buy maize flour than make it at home for various reasons, which include low income earnings of the majority of the populace which makes it difficult to buy or farm maize.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmud,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />New York student Benjamin “Benjy” Firester has won one of the United States’ top young science prizes for his research on the devastating microorganism which caused the Irish Potato Famine, devising a computer model that could prevent it causing billions of dollars in lost crops every year.<br /><br />The 18-year-old senior at Hunter College High School beat 1,800 students in the race to the $250,000 first prize at the Regeneron Science Talent Search, which counts 13 Nobel Prize-winners among its alumni. He also joins his older sister Kalia, who finished a runner-up in 2015, CNN reported.<br /><br />Firester’s project, titled “Modeling the Spatio-Temporal Dynamics of Phytophthora infestans on a Regional Scale,” mapped disease data and weather patterns to predict where spores that cause potato late blight would spread to next. The study involved Firester using data from Israeli farmers and weather reports of the region, factoring in humidity levels and wind direction.<br /><br />Potato late blight can destroy fields in days, and was central to the Irish Potato Famine in the 1840s when 2 million people died from starvation and disease. The problem of potato late blight, though not as acute, persists. One 2012 paper estimated the value of yield losses due to the disease could be as high as $6.7 billion annually.<br /><br />Firester says in his project that farmers are currently forced to preemptively douse fields in fungicide, but suggests his mathematical model could be used in a decision support system where farmers share infection data, enabling them to make more informed decisions to protect their crops.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nuFvclDsEbA/WqpOeGUAH2I/AAAAAAAABPc/SRH_47ApFuAvAacIeMCGoLMFuitecWvSgCLcBGAs/s1600/potato-360x360.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"360\" data-original-width=\"360\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-nuFvclDsEbA/WqpOeGUAH2I/AAAAAAAABPc/SRH_47ApFuAvAacIeMCGoLMFuitecWvSgCLcBGAs/s320/potato-360x360.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Potato farmers in Bolivia, 2005. A paper in 2012 estimated the value of yield loss to potato late blight could be as high as $6.7 billion annually.<br /><br />“Benjy’s project melds several different STEM (science, technology, engineering and math) fields,” said Sudarshan Chawathe, chair of the judging panel. “His use of existing data to make predictions is innovative, and we are impressed by Benjy’s long-term commitment to his research.”<br /><br />According to CNN report, the 77th edition of the competition, run by The Society for Science and the Public, reached its conclusion with a gala in Washington D.C. on Tuesday evening.<br /><br />“To be completely honest I didn’t even think it was real at first,” said Firester about his win. “I could barely breathe; my heart was beating so quickly. It just seemed like a dream.”<br /><br />UNN gears towards replicating foreign science model<br />Speaking in advance of the awards, Society president and CEO Maya Ajmera caveated that it was not just Firester’s research that sealed the win.<br /><br />“It’s not only about the projects, it’s about the intense interviews (each finalist is submitted to). …They are asked questions about general knowledge, scientific issues, puzzles, you name it.”<br />“(The judges are) looking for the next generation of scientific leaders and Benjamin really exemplifies that,” she added.<br /><br />Firester enters an esteemed alumni network alongside 39 other finalists, each receiving a minimum of $25,000 to put towards educational purposes.<br /><br />Second place and $175,000 went to Natalia Dmitrievna Orlovsky from Pennsylvania, who examined the response of lung cells to vaping. Third place and $150,000 was awarded to Isani Singh from Colorado, who looked into the genetics of women with Turner Syndrome, a gene abnormality in which the second s3x chromosome is missing.<br /><br />The winner says he plans to use the $250,000 top prize to pay for college tuition — most likely studying mathematics and computer science at Harvard University. In doing so he’d follow in the footsteps of his sister, who enrolled in 2015 and studies chemical and physical biology and visual and environmental studies.<br /><br />“She’s been one of my biggest inspirations,” he said. As for their parents, “they’re so proud of me,” he added. “My mom might have been the only person who ever thought this was possible.”<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Nigeria’s agriculture needs more involvement of the youth as the majority of farmers are old and slow in technology compliance, Cooperate Farmers International (CFI) has said.&nbsp; Mr Akinwale Alabi, Co-founder of CFI, said on Wednesday in Lagos that 80 per cent of Nigerian farmers were digital immigrants (elderly people) with only 40 per cent technology-compliance. Old Farmers Alabi spoke in an interview with newsmen in Lagos.<br /><br />“The remaining 20 per cent are young farmers with 90 per cent acceptability of technology; there is this excitement about technology and farming among them,”he said. Akinwale said&nbsp; that Nigeria was growing slowly in agricultural technology.<br /><br />&nbsp;“Technology has helped to solve a lot of problems ranging from accessing bank facility to gauging the quantity of rain needed in a soil for a particular plant.&nbsp; “With innovation, some many people and banks are beginning to see light in agriculture.<br /><br />“Although, it is slow, it is beginning to grow gradually; there is no much investment right now, but it will soon pick up,” he said. Alabi said that all the equipment and innovations in place for agricultural technology were health-friendly.

Somehow, we as a society abandoned the agriculture sector of our economy.<br /><br />“Agriculture became an afterthought and we forced our farmers into poverty.<br /><br />“Thankfully, Nigerians have now woken up to the fact that it is an embarrassment for us, as a nation, to import most of what we eat, given the great natural gifts of our country.<br /><br />“We have the fertile land, we have water and the manpower to feed ourselves. Therefore, we have no reason to import essential foodstuffs.<br /><br />“When we came in 2015, there were 13 rice mills in Nigeria. Twelve of these were built between 2009 and 2015.

Atiku Bagudu of Kebbi, who led the rice stakeholders to the Villa, told State House reporters that “Nigeria currently produces about 17 million metric tons of paddy rice per annum, up from 5.7 million metric tons in 2015.’’<br /><br />He, however, frowned at the activities of smugglers whom he said had been flooding the country with foreign rice, thereby compromising efforts of government in rice production.<br /><br />Bagudu described the inaction of those countries allowing smuggled rice into the country as undertaking economic warfare on Nigeria.<br /><br />He said: “Yesterday (Monday), the Economic Management Team discussed the issue of smuggling and today it was an important feature at this meeting too.<br /><br />“It has been recognized, everyone who knows Mr President’s commitment to the Nigerian economy will appreciate his annoyance with smuggling and smugglers.<br /><br />“But it is a collective responsibility and so we want all Nigerians to participate in stopping this menace of importing this commodity, rice.<br /><br />“The narrative out there is wrong, other countries are undertaking economic warfare on us, there is no nation in the world that can produce and sell to Nigeria freshly grown rice equivalent to what is produced in Nigeria at the prices that Nigeria farmers are selling.<br /><br />“So, most of the prices of smuggled rice are discounted prices that reflect the age of that rice and in some cases, as identified by NAFDAC, not fit for human consumption.”<br /><br /><b>Source: Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Al-Hassan said: “The Agricultural Transformation Agenda is aimed at strengthening the agricultural value chain, achieving a hunger-free nation, accelerating food and nutritional security, generating employment and growing wealth for millions of farmers “The current Anchor Borrowers Programme of the Federal Government has released over 122 million dollars to farmers through 13 participating institutions.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6IZaV_q1npI/Wqju8So0_CI/AAAAAAAABPI/JqaqvqMy3ec4jIyvPLgZMRRZctFDvfN9ACLcBGAs/s1600/Buhari.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"285\" data-original-width=\"412\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6IZaV_q1npI/Wqju8So0_CI/AAAAAAAABPI/JqaqvqMy3ec4jIyvPLgZMRRZctFDvfN9ACLcBGAs/s1600/Buhari.jpg\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;“This is to spur the production of additional two million tonnes of rice in 2018 by 300,000 Rice Farmers, majority of whom are women in rural areas”. She said the Muhammadu Buhari-led Government was determined to meet the overarch objectives of poverty eradication and the empowerment of rural women and girls for sustainable development, inherent in Agenda 2030. According to her, the Nigerian Government has taken rigorous steps to initiate and strengthen policies, institutional frameworks, systems and mechanisms aimed at achieving gender equality and empowerment of women and girls.<br /><br />She said some of the implementable strategies were designed to harness the socio-economic potentials of Nigeria’s 83.3 million female population. Al-Hassan said the development and launch of Economic Growth and Recovery Plan gave prominence to the inclusion and empowerment of women in the rural areas and linked national development strategies to Agenda 2030 in an integrated, multi-sectoral and multifaceted manner.<br /><br />On Girl-Child education, she said government wad implementing with more vigour a universal basic education programme strategically directed at enhancing girl child education at the grass root level. She said the implementation of the N-Power job Creation and Youth Employment Programme, which targetted gainful and sustainable employment for 500,000 graduates and 100,000 non-graduates, had taken off successfully in the country.<br /><br />“Consequently 200,000 N-Power graduates have been successfully deployed to serve in local communities in the country with another batch of 300,000 graduate volunteers already pre-selected,” she said. Al-Hassan said additional 10,000 artisans were being trained in the construction and automobile sub-sectors in close collaboration with the Council of Registered Builders of Nigeria and the National Automotive Design and Development Council.<br /><br />She said government was implementing the implementation of the Conditional Cash Transfer scheme, aimed at providing one million poor and vulnerable households with N5,000 monthly cash transfers to the “care givers of households”. “As at December 2017, over 622,649 identified poor and vulnerable households have been enlisted in the programme with over 439,859 captured in the National Social Register from 233 Local Government Areas across 23 States.<br /><br />“Of these figures, 293,973 caregivers from 9,567 communities have been paid, with over 25,000 beneficiaries already accessing requisite skills through trained community facilitators. “The Home Grown School Feeding programme, also part of the social investment programme is designed to provide one nutritious meal a day to 5.5 million school children, including girls in classes one to three of public primary schools is progressing.<br /><br />“By December 2017, over six million pupils are being fed daily nationwide. The programme has trickled down financial incentives to local farmers and cooks, who are mostly women,” the minister said. She said the Government Enterprise and Empowerment Programme and the National Women Empowerment Fund, also under the government’s Social Investment Programme, were designed to provide 1.66 million dollars micro credit, lending to businesses at the bottom of the financial pyramid.<br /><br />According to her, the soft conditions of zero collateral, zero interest and only five per cent administrative fee attached to the loans had resulted in the disbursement of over 250 million dollars loans directly to beneficiaries as at December 2017. The minister disclosed that plans had been concluded to establish eight technology innovation hubs across the country, to extend technology to rural communities.<br /><br />“Already, a pilot Adamawa Humanitarian Innovation Hub, known as the North East Makeathon Company, was opened in the last quarter of 2017, while the Lagos Climate Change Hub, designed to facilitate generation of ideas on renewable energy and reduction of pollution, is set to commence in March 2018. She said conscious of the centrality of the empowerment of rural women and girls to the realisation of objectives of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, AU Agenda 2063 and the Beijing Declaration and Platform of Action, Nigeria would redouble efforts to improve access to productive resources for rural women and girls and ensure the protection of their fundamental rights.

    "title": "Why Indigenous Cattle cannot Produce 2 Litre of Milk Daily – Prof. Sharubutu",
    "content": "<br />Professor Garba Hamidu Sharubutu is the Provost, Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology and President of the Veterinary Council of Nigeria. The one time President of Nigeria Veterinary Medical Association speaks to Daily Trust on Sunday on the ongoing debate on cattle ranching/colonies and what government can do to improve the livestock sector.<br /><br />There is a lot of controversy on the concepts of ranching, cattle colony, and grazing reserves can you explain them as applicable in Nigeria?<br /><br />A ranch is a vast area of land provided for animals to graze on natural range. But you can define any subject matter within the context of what you want to achieve and so, what is termed ranch now from the perspective of our policy as a nation is livestock farming where you design a little place and keep your animals within a fenced area such that they would not be roaming around like the traditional system we are used to in trans-human pastoralism. So, a ranch for us, based on the policy that is being promoted is a confined area that will allow for the rearing of livestock and provide a grazing area of sole pasture and improved seed that would provide high nutrition, water and a small health care facility. But in a typical sense, a ranch is a vast area of land that is supposed to hold a large livestock that can be reproducing.<br /><br />The idea of a grazing colony comes from the fact that if you have an aggregation of ranches put together, they form a colony. The government had wanted to promote this so that the communities where these ranches would be established can come together and form a colony of ranches. Therefore, having different ranches located in the same area so they become a colony of ranches not necessarily a colony that should be colonized by anybody as being speculated.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ccsa9Zmaj_s/WqfDNbuw7OI/AAAAAAAABOI/4CwTUi8mtqIVntdXd8mOnrcHGR2w7NKYACLcBGAs/s1600/Professor%2BGarba%2BHamidu.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"743\" data-original-width=\"634\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ccsa9Zmaj_s/WqfDNbuw7OI/AAAAAAAABOI/4CwTUi8mtqIVntdXd8mOnrcHGR2w7NKYACLcBGAs/s320/Professor%2BGarba%2BHamidu.jpg\" width=\"273\" /></a></div><br />On the other hand, a grazing reserve was an attempt by our colonial masters to see how they could curtail the distraction of crops. The concept there was to use areas that are not fertile for crop production for grazing so that the typical herdsman does not leave that area and go to another area. That area will be registered. But because of the weather, when there is no water, the herdsmen will move through a definite path to the nouth where they can have access to water and other things. That was the initiative of the white men, and apart from that, they brought a policy to introduce the Fulani Amenity Programme because they understood that keeping the animal in one location (grazing reserve) does not actually solve the problem since the herdsmen will relocate from one place to the other in search of water. In the Fulani Aamenity Programme, the white men decided to provide what we call the livestock service center where they can have clinics, dams, etc, for the livestock. That was the concept of a grazing reserve and we have 417 of them that have been gazetted and known to exist but unfortunately they have been encroached onto.<br /><br />What are the likely advantages of ranching or colonies as compared to the traditional pastoralism?<br /><br />You see, pastoralism is more of a culture rather than a business. For anyone practicing pastoralism, you will find out that he is attached. His children, more often than not would not be going to school because they would continuously move from one place to the other. Secondly, the animals will waste the little resources they are consuming because they are undertaking one form of movement or another, so the movement wares away all the energy they are supposed to convert into feed. Pastoralism does not allow for the development of the cattle themselves, what we are seeing today as cattle are actually animals that have undergone improved breeding. The pastorals and the cattle are moving around and the cattle are mixing with all forms of animals so the good male will climb a bad female and vice versa. So, developmentally, the livestock system does not actually grow and that is exactly what we are faced with today. The implication of this is that we will continue to lose these animals and the inheritance of these people practicing pastoralism will keep reducing because they do not learn any other trade and they do not go to school the ultimate aim is to take to criminality. But with ranches, markets will spring up and because of that, economic activities will be boosted, it will be easy to transport the animals from one place to the other and people who sell feed will be there and those who want to fight diseases will be there so you don’t have diseases moving from one place to the other and it will be easy to take census of the animals.<br /><br />On the other hand, the little advantage pastoralism has is that it allows for people who are not really rich to get a means of livelihood from rearing their animals. But definitely, that is not a sound economic venture. Another advantage of pastoralism again is that it is responsible for the reduction of the cost of the meat that we have today in this country because not much is invested in the animals in terms of feeding and so the per kilo price of livestock product does not put into consideration the cost of producing them. So, the cost of meat is relatively low because the investment put in producing them is not very high.<br /><br />There are those who say the Nigerian breed of cattle is not good for ranching as such cannot produce the expected result. How true is this?<br /><br />We have different breeds of animals and these breeds are characterized differently. For instance we have the Sokoto Gudali, Keteku, Balaji, Kauri, etc. All these breeds have their potentials. Some are good in milk production while others are good in meat production, among other potentials. Now, the feed conversion ability of our own indigenous cows are different and the ones that come from other countries are improved breeds produced through research. The problem is that we have not been able to invest in research to improve our own local animals. Any breed of animal that is not a good converter of feed cannot be used for ranching because ranching is a business while pastoralism is a culture. If one decides to confine OR’s kind of animals in one place (ranching) I can bet you that you cannot make the kind of profit you want. For example, our local cows, no matter what you do to them or feed you give them, cannot give you two liters of milk a day. But the foreign ones can give you 20 liters a day. It is just like our local chickens, no matter how you feed or nurture them, they can never give you the desired eggs because they have not been improved upon. So, if we must go into ranching, we must improve on the breeds of animals because it will be pure business.<br /><br />Some people have criticized the Federal Government for meddling in what they say is a private business of the herders. What is your take on that?<br /><br />What brought about this is actually the issue of indegenshisp and settlership syndrome and people are manifesting them in different dimensions. There is no how government cannot be involved in cattle business. Look at a taxi driver for instance, he relies on the road constructed by the government. Is the taxi not his private business? Government can create an enabling environment for any business and then ask you to pay tax. Government has been promoting cassava, rice and other crops, is farming not a private business? Government constructs some dams strictly for irrigation, like the Hadejia River Basin, Benue River Basin, and others. These river basins are constructed by the government to assist the farmers and all government needs to do is to create an enabling environment for business, no matter what it is. By so doing, employment opportunities will be provided for people. One of the greatest mistakes government made was the abandoning of the cattle tax. Just look at the cattle market, everybody will come and dump their cattle for sale without tax; cattle business can’t grow that way. Government should also regulate animal rearing or grazing. It could come up with a law banning night grazing, or that people of certain ages should not be rearing animals.<br /><br /><b>By Lami Sadiq &amp; Dickson S.

    "content": "<br />Dried tomato dealers in Katsina State have said the poor market price of fresh tomatoes is not a determining factor for massive sun-drying of the produce usually experienced yearly in the area.<br /><br />Dried tomato business is fast gaining ground in the state, generating high revenue to its dealers; especially in the months of April, May and June when scarcity of fresh tomatoes reaches its peak.<br /><br />The Secretary of Dried Tomato Sellers Association (DTSA) in Danja Local Government Area, Mohammed Kabir Tukur, said though price instability had always been an issue in fresh tomato market, but that it had never been a determining factor of how much of the produce would be dried.<br /><br />“Drying tomatoes has gradually become a sort of value addition to the produce considering its perishable nature and lack of modern processing plants in our area. Many of us make more money from it than from the fresh produce; especially in the months of April and June when the fresh one is acutely scarce,” he said.<br /><br />He added that in comparison to the last two years, fresh tomatoes, this year, yielded more profit to its farmers as the least they sold a basket was N1,000; and that it did not stop them from massively sun-drying it for future sales.<br /><br />“Most times when fresh tomatoes are expensive, there is likelihood that dried ones too would be expensive before the rain-fed ones start bearing fruits,” Kabir explained.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vcH1wJAJONE/Wqe6Hd7I10I/AAAAAAAABN4/9IFnX_zsIYo1Df-V7acWJ0cdCSA9vzm-wCLcBGAs/s1600/Dry%2BTomatoes.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"375\" data-original-width=\"500\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vcH1wJAJONE/Wqe6Hd7I10I/AAAAAAAABN4/9IFnX_zsIYo1Df-V7acWJ0cdCSA9vzm-wCLcBGAs/s320/Dry%2BTomatoes.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Daily Trust observed that a 100kg bag of dried tomatoes now cost between N10,000 and N14,000 depending on its quality; but that in the month of June the price can reach up to N30,000.<br /><br />A tomato dealer at Kokami Market, Usman Abdullahi, said for the first time in the history of their business, the Katsina State Government had in collaboration with some agro-companies been trying to modernise the process of drying the produce.<br /><br />“To modernise the preservation processes of the produce, the Katsina State Government, in partnership with some companies, is trying to supply us with reliable drier machines for quality output. The one they brought last year was not economical for the business as it guzzled over N7,000 fuel before it dried a basket of tomato. In our traditional way we pay not more than N150 to slice and spread a basket of tomatoes in the sun,” said Abdullahi.<br /><br />He added that they were now waiting for a more economical machine to substitute the first one they brought.<br /><br />The Vice Chairman of DTSA in Kokami Market, Mal. Rabi’u Isah, thanked Governor Aminu Bello Masari for giving attention to the agricultural sector in the state.<br /><br />Isah said, “We remain grateful to this administration for its effort to modernise our business and the establishment of a tomato processing factory that is nearing completion at Kokami, as well as the proposed Danja Irrigation Dam to boost agricultural activities in the area.”<br /><br />He also appealed to the state government to speed up the completion of the projects for the benefit of the masses in the area.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmoud,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Irrigation farming suffers a setback this farming season in Jigawa State following shortage of fuel as farmers who engaged in dry season farming using pumping machines for irrigation cut down the sizes of their farms.<br /><br />Yield in most of the crops is expected to drop as high cost of fuel has forced most farmers to reduce the sizes of their farms to levels that their financial capabilities can afford them to take care of.<br /><br />Dry season farmers, who are mostly rural dwellers, hardly go to the cities where perhaps they can buy fuel at controlled prices.<br /><br />The farmers rely for their supply from the black market, where a litre of petrol goes for between N250 and N300 depending on location. Those in hard-to-reach areas buy at exorbitant prices because transportation to such areas adds increases the cost of the product.<br /><br />Checks at some farms in Miga and Birnin Kudu local government areas of the state indicate that the hike in the petroleum product did not only make some farmers to reduce the size of their farms, but that also, some farmers were forced out of dry season farming completely.<br /><br />Many of them have gone into commercial motorcycling to fend for their families. But for the fact that they are not into full time commercial motorcycle business, they generate little income for solving their immediate needs and save the greater part to inject back into their farms.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6EG-_USgn3w/Wqe1PkyNyII/AAAAAAAABNo/bJyHYv_XWhcGiIrrCYmiTD5HEbKDFlS6wCLcBGAs/s1600/Irrigation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"259\" data-original-width=\"660\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6EG-_USgn3w/Wqe1PkyNyII/AAAAAAAABNo/bJyHYv_XWhcGiIrrCYmiTD5HEbKDFlS6wCLcBGAs/s1600/Irrigation.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Because of the high cost of maintaining an irrigation farm, even prior to the petroleum shortage, an individual farmer does not go for a big farm because the bigger the farm the much needed for maintaining it.<br /><br />For the fact that they cultivate variety of crops in different plots of land, the farmers go for only two or a maximum of four hectares per crop for effective management.<br /><br />For two hectares, one needs two to three litres of fuel, and in some instances even more depending on how effective a pumping machine is. An old pumping machine can consume four litres per hectare.<br /><br />The frequency of irrigation depends on a farm’s ability to retain moisture because water application is twice to thrice in week, depending on the retention capability of the soil.<br /><br />Malam Sani, who hitherto irrigated four hectares of maize, cannot now maintain one hectare for this year’s dry season farming owing to what he described as high operational cost.<br /><br />While speaking to Daily Trust on phone, Sani said in the past he spent not more than N12,000 on fuel from planting to harvesting; which was a period of three months.<br /><br />He said he had to abandon irrigation farming after calculating what he would spend on fuel alone.<br /><br />He added that he had two farms of the same size; one for rice and the other for maize, and that he had to abandon that of maize so that he would concentrate on that of rice.<br /><br />He further explained that even the rice farm, if care was not taken, some issues would come up which could stop him from cultivating.<br /><br />He explained that if it happened that the way he abandoned his maize farm some of his neighbours in the rice farm also decided to abandon theirs, then he would not be able to cultivate the rice farm.<br /><br />On why he cannot farm it, he said when you irrigated in the midst of many, your land consumed little water and stores moisture for a longer period because the day that you did not irrigate your neighbour would and the moisture would go all round.<br /><br />Abdulhadi Isa of Maiganjara village in Miga Local Government Area told this reporter that in the past, he used to farm two hectares of maize during irrigation farming season, but that now he was forced to reduce to one and half because of high cost of fuel.<br /><br />He said though he did not calculate how much he spent before harvest, he knew that this time around it was not going to be business as usual, hence the decision to cut the size of his farm.<br /><br />Isa further said he irrigated his farm twice a week and that he bought two to three litters of fuel depending on the need for water, adding that the cost of fuelling his pumping machine had deflated his little savings.<br /><br />He noted he would not go into dry season farming next irrigation season even if the price of fuel stabilised unless there was good price for their commodity this year as that was the only way that they would be able to recoup their investment.<br /><br />Isa said he harvested about 15 bags last year, but that by reducing his farm size he now expects six to seven bags.<br /><br />He, therefore, appealed to the authorities concerned to come to their aid and provide them with fuel.<br /><br />“Last year about 300 people from our village, Maiganjara, were into maize irrigation farming, but this year, because of high cost of fuel, about 70 per cent cannot cultivate,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By Aliyu M.

    "content": "<br />Rice Farmers’ Association of Nigeria (RIFAN), Zaria Local Government chapter, said on Monday that it had withdrawn from the Federal Government’s RIFAN loan scheme due to alleged shady deals.<br /><br />The Chairman, Malam Mohammed Lawal-Jibril, made the disclosure while addressing Journalists in Zaria, Kaduna State.<br /><br />The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) recalls that the Federal Government, in collaboration with Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), had introduced the RIFAN loan scheme to boost rice production and make Nigeria self-sufficient in rice production.<br /><br />Lawal-Jibril said his members pulled out of the scheme because it was not designed to assist the poor farmers, instead, it was meant to enrich some few individuals outside the business.<br /><br />The chairman lauded the efforts of the Federal Government and the (CBN) for initiating the scheme.<br /><br />He, however, said the entire scheme was hijacked by some selfish individuals, who were now exploiting the opportunity to their advantage at the expense of genuine farmers.<br /><br />“Fertiliser was sold at N5,500 government approved price; but why should rice farmers pay N8,500 for a bag?<br /><br />“If it cannot be subsidised below N5,500 why not give it to us at government price.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JCisTmz1TVs/WqeuW9o1YgI/AAAAAAAABNY/Dbpdo_jCt_IMAFgUvZqwbXTsoLGesNfHACLcBGAs/s1600/Rice%2Bfarmer.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JCisTmz1TVs/WqeuW9o1YgI/AAAAAAAABNY/Dbpdo_jCt_IMAFgUvZqwbXTsoLGesNfHACLcBGAs/s1600/Rice%2Bfarmer.jpg\" /></a></div>“In a similar vein, the prices of sprayer, seeds, chemicals and all other tools are inflated. Apart from that, harrowing, planting and harvest per hectare were all inflated because it is going to done by somebody not the farmer himself.<br /><br />“Therefore, RIFAN Zaria chapter is pulling out of this scheme because of some shady deals there; there are some regulations that are detrimental to farmers and farming business.<br /><br />“We have carefully examined the scheme and realised that a farmer will eventually gain nothing at the end of the programme,” he said.<br /><br />The chairman said that at the initial stage, they were told something different but when things unfolded, they saw something different from what they were told.<br /><br />He recalled that when the RIFAN Chairman in Kaduna State, Alhaji Junaidu Zubairu-Birnin-Daji visited Zaria, he publicly admitted that the scheme had encountered some problems<br /><br />Lawal-Jibril said the state chairman, however, pledged to bring sanity into the scheme with a view to correcting the scheme for the good of both individual farmer and the entire society.<br /><br />He wondered how a farmer could benefit from a scheme where all the farming activities would be done by separate companies on his farmland?<br /><br />He advised the Federal Government to urgently re-visit the scheme in order to make necessary corrections to enable the progrmme record the desired success.<br /><br />When contacted, the RIFAN Chairman in Kaduna State, Alhaji Junaidu Zubairu-Birnin-Daji, debunked the allegation, saying that Zaria chapter needed to be given money instead of farming inputs.<br /><br />“They are not real farmers, they want us to give them money not the inputs. If you are a real farmer and you are given the farming inputs, all you have to do is to go ahead and continue with the business.<br /><br />“However, on the issue of harrowing, ploughing and ridging, this is where they should have emphasised because N10,000 is set aside for each of these per hectare.<br /><br />“We arrived at this after estimating how much will be spent to cultivate a hectare of land,” he said.<br /><br />On farmers benefits after the exercise, the chairman said it was expected that the water pump machines, sprayers and other tools would still be useful to the farmer because they were not to be refunded.

    "title": "Who are the Cattle Owners in Nigeria?",
    "content": "<br />while India has sacred cows, Nigeria has sacred cow owners. That’s why, despite the atrocities being perpetrated by cows and their herders across the country, the ownership of the estimated 19.5 million cows in Nigeria remains shrouded in secrecy. Surely, the herdsmen we see carrying AK-47 rifles and following the cows through the highways, villages, and farmlands are not the owners of the cows they tend. Rather, they are hired by the cattle owners to ensure that the cattle are fed and defended against rustling and other dangers.<br /><br />We also know that the herdsmen are organised into an association known as the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria. Speaking at the General Assembly of the Interfaith Dialogue Forum for Peace on January 18, 2018, the Sultan of Sokoto, Muhammadu Sa’ad Abubakar III, revealed that MACBAN was established over 32 years ago to cater for the welfare of its members and advance the growth of the Fulani business. By the Fulani business here is meant cattle rearing. MACBAN has a branch in each of the six zones of the country, which often promptly intervenes on matters concerning the herdsmen within its zone.<br /><br />True, the leadership of MACBAN owns some of the cattle; but the vast majority of the cattle are owned by people outside the association. This leads to several questions: Who are the cattle owners in Nigeria? What is their relationship to MACBAN? How many heads of cattle does each of them own? How much tax do they pay on each head of cattle? Let us examine these questions more closely.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_OTNthc0ENs/Wd_SApnhJiI/AAAAAAAAAT0/-qhgjWj_pcEoqDdkvm0wYDftwr72cuoJACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Fulani.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_OTNthc0ENs/Wd_SApnhJiI/AAAAAAAAAT0/-qhgjWj_pcEoqDdkvm0wYDftwr72cuoJACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Fulani.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Beyond the leadership of MACBAN, the first suspects are the patrons of the association. The list consists of the echelons of Fulani oligarchs. Here’s the list as recounted recently by one of them, the Emir of Kano, Muhammadu Sanusi II: “The first grand patron was Sultan Abubakar III; and he was replaced by successive sultans-Dasuki, Maccido and Saad Abubakar now. Other patrons were the Lamido of Adamawa, and emirs of Zazzau and Katsina. So, my predecessor was a patron and on my ascension to the throne, I became a patron” (The PUNCH, January 14, 2018).<br /><br />My investigation reveals that the vast majority of the Fulani elite each owns hundreds or thousands of heads of cattle. It will be recalled, for example, that President Muhammadu Buhari revealed in his assets declaration in 2015 that he owned “farms, an orchard, and a ranch … 270 heads of cattle, 25 sheep, five horses, a variety of birds and a number of economic trees” (Vanguard, September 3, 2015). In view of the ongoing controversy over cattle colonies, it is interesting to note that Buhari owns a ranch in which, it must be assumed, his animals are kept.<br /><br />Informal enquiries within the last three months further reveal that the ownership of cattle goes well beyond the Fulani. Many Northern politicians of various ethnicities, especially governors, senators, and members of the House of Representatives as well as their predecessors in office, also own cattle. So do businessmen and thousands of livestock farmers. It is also true of military and ex-military officers from the North.<br /><br />Interestingly, the ownership of cattle in Nigeria is not limited to Northerners. There is no state in the federation in which cattle owners do not reside with their cattle. And not all of such owners are Northerners. In every state, there are indigenes who own cattle. For example, the rumour is very rife that Senator David Mark, an Idoma from Benue State, owns several hundreds of heads of cattle.<br /><br />What seems to be common to all cattle owners in the country is the hiring of Fulani herdsmen to tend their cattle, often through the local MACBAN branch. This is in recognition of pastoralism as their traditional occupation. The implication is that there are Fulani herdsmen resident in virtually every state in the federation. This is why, for example, many Benue residents claimed that they knew some of the herdsmen who plundered their villages and killed residents.<br /><br />So far, the people’s anger has been directed at these herdsmen, who are being blamed for the serial conflicts with local farmers, whose farmlands and entire villages are being plundered by the cattle. It is high time the owners of the cattle were brought into the equation. There are several reasons to do so, and urgently too.<br /><br />First, if my neighbour’s gateman drives the neighbour’s goat into my compound and the goat eats up the bunch of plantain in my backyard, I will not stop at blaming the gateman. Rather, I will report both the gateman and the goat to my neighbour and demand that the goat be gated within his compound. If the incident goes on repeatedly, I may double my demand — cage the goat and also pay reparation. If that fails, I will sue him. This rule should apply to cow owners. The problem is that we do not know them.<br /><br />Yet, second, it is believed that the explanation for the sudden upsurge in the marauding exploits of the herdsmen and their killing binge goes beyond them and feeding cows. There is probably a hidden agenda, which, it is believed, may implicate the cattle owners themselves. Former President Olusegun Obasanjo hinted at this in his comment at the graveside of the 73 Benue victims last week: “Whatever is behind this … we must get to the root of it; and until we get to the root of this we will be burying victims … we must know why this is happening”.<br /><br />Third, it is necessary to know the source of the AK-47 rifles carried by the herdsmen in full public glare. Where do the arms come from and who is arming them? The other day, I saw four herdsmen march about 200 heads of cattle past an army checkpoint and a police checkpoint within 200 metres of each other. I wondered why they were not arrested and disarmed in keeping with the President’s order to do so.<br /><br />Why do security officers appear complicit in the herdsmen’s crime? Why is the Federal Government always ready to appease the herdsmen instead of blaming them for their crime, while delaying, if not denying, the necessary attention to the victims? Why is the focus more on building cattle colonies than in rebuilding plundered villages and compensating the victims? These questions are being raised because many believe that there are powerful interests behind the herdsmen’s atrocities.<br /><br />Fourth, it is necessary to know the cattle owners so that the Federal Inland Revenue Service could collect the appropriate tax from them. Millions of people must be raking in profit from the sale of cows, beef, milk, cowherd, and so on. The Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, and the FIRS should be keenly interested in them.<br /><br />Finally, it is high time reliable statistics were generated that would provide necessary data for planners and researchers interested in livestock farming in Nigeria. Such data should be able to tell us who owns what breed of cattle and where? If such data are not available now, where does the figure of 19.5 million heads of cattle come from? On what basis is the government planning its intervention in the ongoing conflicts between herdsmen and farmers? Appropriate data are needed and necessary taxes should be collected, if livestock farming were to make a dent on Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product.<br /><br /><b>By: Niyi Akinnaso</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The National Wet Season Agricultural Performance Survey (APS) 2017 has shown serious decrease in aquaculture and artisanal fish production in some states compared to the performance in 2016.<br /><br />The survey was conducted by the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS), in collaboration with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and state Ministries of Agriculture.<br /><br />The report, however, attributed the decline in fish production to the high cost of fish feeds, poor market, non-access to credit facilities, aquatic pests and diseases, among others.<br /><br />Adamawa produced 10,000 tonnes of fish in 2017, as against 20,000 tonnes produced in 2016; while fish production in Bauchi State and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) recorded a decrease of 21.62 per cent and 71 per cent in 2017 respctively.<br /><br />Kogi produced 20,955 tonnes of fish in 2017, as against 271,315.11 tonnes produced in 2016, while Akwa Ibom recorded a 46 per cent decrease, producing 96,590 tonnes of fish, as against 178,871 tonnes produced in 2016.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tC_8qVWAegI/WqE0se10XJI/AAAAAAAABMo/bYHEICCzon0NBmGulp5eywaS6SL-GEtPwCLcBGAs/s1600/Fish%2BProduction.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-tC_8qVWAegI/WqE0se10XJI/AAAAAAAABMo/bYHEICCzon0NBmGulp5eywaS6SL-GEtPwCLcBGAs/s320/Fish%2BProduction.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />However, the report indicated a slight increase in fish production in Gombe, Kwara and Oyo states.<br /><br />It noted that Nigeria’s per capita fish consumption of 11kg was still lower than the global average of 21kg.<br /><br />The report said the country’s total annual fish demand was estimated at 2.7 million tonnes, with the country’s fish farmers producing only 30 per cent of the figure, resulting in an annual expenditure of N125bn on fish imports.<br /><br />It listed some fish diseases that contributed to the drop in production as fin rot, abdominal swelling, fish louse, bacterial diseases, abdominal dropsy, broken head diseases, among others.<br /><br />News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) reports that the maiden agricultural performance report was officially launched on February 27, as a public document to guide agriculture-based decisions in the country.<br /><br /><b>Source: Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Blood meal is simply a powder made from animal blood that is used either as organic fertiliser or as a component of animal feed.<br /><br />It is an excellent source of nitrogen when used as fertiliser for plants when compared to other natural fertilisers. Blood meal also has significant phosphorus and calcium; as such it’s perfect for vegetable gardening.<br /><br />Similarly, blood meal could be a successful replacement of protein sources in various animal feeds for dairy cattle, beef cattle, sheep, poultry, fish etc.<br /><br />According to feedipedia.com, blood meal can be prepared by either solar drying, oven drying, drum drying, flash drying or by spray drying.<br /><br />However, for small-scale production, the solar drying method is most suitable.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1s7wy8kY6xA/WfGmwtUg_jI/AAAAAAAAAjs/B6P_0PaUaIoYlcfPBLxBTzb3fiktEiAGACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Bag%2Bof%2BMillet.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1s7wy8kY6xA/WfGmwtUg_jI/AAAAAAAAAjs/B6P_0PaUaIoYlcfPBLxBTzb3fiktEiAGACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Bag%2Bof%2BMillet.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />In order to make blood meal using the solar method, blood should be collected from abattoirs. It is then boiled while stirring constantly, and when moisture has considerably reduced to between 10 per cent and 12 per cent, it should be spread on a clean surface and allowed to sun-dry or oven-dry.<br /><br />Meanwhile, plantcaretoday.com advises that because blood meal is a concentrated source of nitrogen, excessive application should be avoided.<br /><br />Since blood meal is water soluble, it can be dissolved in water and used as liquid fertiliser, mixed directly into soil or as a component in making compost.<br /><br />Again, because blood meal is not very palatable, it is not advisable to include high quantity in livestock feed.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Many state governments are not keying into the Federal Government’s drive for agricultural mechanisation thereby leaving majority of their farmers to use age-long hoes and cutlasses.<br /><br />In Nigeria, agriculture is on the Concurrent List, just like health, education, road and housing.<br /><br />A 2017 Agricultural Performance Survey for the wet season exposed most of the states that pay lip service to agriculture.<br /><br />The national report was conducted by the National Agricultural Extension and Research Liaison Services (NAERLS) of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, which is domiciled in the Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria.<br /><br />The report released to the public last week by the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Dr. Heineken Lokpobiri, for example, puts the number of tractors owned by 26 state governments in 2017 at 964.<br /><br />“Data on tractor availability and functionality were collected from Agricultural Development Programmes (ADPs), state Ministries of Agriculture and relevant agencies nationwide. Data provided by 26 states and the FCT give the total number of functional government tractors in 2016 and 2017 as 908 and 964 respectively. Non-functional government-owned tractors in 2016 and 2017 were 539 and 524, a reduction of 2.78 per cent,” the national report indicated.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6b72kiDXNts/WdcyXDd2k6I/AAAAAAAAAQY/NOstYdHAKhUNv6xZXeGgUayH9QECSi0UgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Agricultural%2BTechnology.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6b72kiDXNts/WdcyXDd2k6I/AAAAAAAAAQY/NOstYdHAKhUNv6xZXeGgUayH9QECSi0UgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Agricultural%2BTechnology.jpg\" /></a></div><br />The report shows that among the 26 states, Plateau has 279 state-owned functional tractors, the highest, closely followed by Yobe with 228.<br /><br />In Nasarawa State none of the state-owned 32 tractors has been functional since 2016, while Kebbi has seven tractors and Imo only two which are grounded. Similarly, Akwa-Ibom, Kwara, Oyo and Rivers have only one functional tractor each, while Abia and Ondo have two functional tractors each.<br /><br />Katsina, which had only one functional tractor in 2016, increased the tally to five during the 2017 wet season.<br /><br />Senior Special Adviser on Agriculture to the Governor of Katsina state, Dr. Abdullah Abba, stressed that the state government, towards the end of 2017-in December, distributed over 200 tractors to farmers, something he said the data did not capture.<br /><br />In response, Dr. Lokpobiri said the tractors were not captured because it was done in December when data were already collected, adding that the study concentrated on the wet season.<br /><br />Some experts have said availability of tractors to local farmers was the only way to scale up production, adding that the reason many youths were not interested in farming was because of the absence of farm machinery to do the job.<br /><br />They believe that most state governments are not doing as expected to complement Federal Government’s effort in view of the fact that 90 per cent of agricultural activities are in the states.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "FAO Begins Forest Inventory in Collaboration with FG in 36 states, FCT",
    "content": "<br />The Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, has commenced process to upscale forest inventory in collaboration with the Federal Government in the 36 States and Federal Capital Territory, FCT, to assess Carbon dioxide, CO2 emissions from deforestation.<br /><br />This was disclosed Monday, by the Forestry Officer, REDD+Programme, Food and Agriculture Organisation, FAO, Dr John Fonweban, while making his remark at the official opening of a two-day Workshop on Forest Reference Emission Level/Forest Emission Level (FREL/FRL) Methodology and Submission to the, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, UNFCCC, which ends on March 6, 2018 in Abuja.<br /><br />According to Fonweban the forest inventory in the 36 states and FCT became imperative, because it would aid the country to find out the quantity of emissions taking place in the country based on the destruction of the different types of forest. He also added to upscale the process across the country, the programme targets Nasarawa, and FAO is to upscale FREL to the national level.<br /><br />He also explained that the workshop has two categories of officers being trained, which include remote sensing and GIS experts and the forest inventory people that are supposed to do the work and determine how much can be loosed in terms of emissions for the different forest types.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1NiLmT15bs/WdcytliKB8I/AAAAAAAAAQU/vdbnWHNVQy4gRJyJSo1I2O6uvDiluRGXwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Food%2Band%2BAgriculture%2BOrganisation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"113\" data-original-width=\"113\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-S1NiLmT15bs/WdcytliKB8I/AAAAAAAAAQU/vdbnWHNVQy4gRJyJSo1I2O6uvDiluRGXwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Food%2Band%2BAgriculture%2BOrganisation.jpg\" /></a></div><br />The REDD+ programme started in 2009 through multi-stakeholder policy dialogue, capacity building with support from the UN-REDD Programme, preliminary assessments, field surveys and joint strategic planning between the Federal Government, Cross River State and the United Nations. He said: “Inventory is very important in what we call the emission factor. It is to find out the quantity of emissions.<br /><br />For forestry is for CO2 that can be emitted if for example one hectare of the tropical forest is destroyed, so we need to quantify them, and we also need to quantify how much a hectare of a Savannah, ecosystem is destroyed, the Guinea Savannah can be lost of one hectare or the mangrove forest is destroyed, with this makes the inventory important.<br /><br />&nbsp;“It is an inventory that covers all the land use types in the sense that you have one hectare of forest destroyed and used for agric plantation you will be able to see how much you are losing. So it goes with the assessment for remote sensing to calculate the emissions and that is why the forest reference has to be done to get the historical changes and emissions that have been taking place in Nigeria as business as usual without any project.<br /><br />&nbsp;“We have to establish that reference level otherwise you will be able to assess the performance of Nigeria in terms of mitigation within the Paris Agreement.” In her assertion the Forestry Officer, Forest Reference Levels for REDD+ Forestry Policy and Resources Division, Food and Policy and Resource Division, FAO, Marieke Sandker, said the UN agency has assisted Nigeria in producing a reference level which is line with the modalities, decisions in line with UNFCCC and scientific community in providing guidance on how countries should be assessed.<br /><br />&nbsp;“The level of emission in cross River State is 15, 7 million+CO2 per year from 2004-2014 from deforestation only. “Nigeria is now one of the countries that have submitted its reference level to UNFOC a show of progress of transparency contributing to framework of the Paris Agreement.<br /><br />This is very important first step. Right now Nigeria is preparing for the assessment at the reference level during which improvement will be implemented. End of May Nigeria will resubmit its modified reference to the UNFCCC.<br /><br />This assessment of the emissions it could still change. “The implication in Nigeria is when once you have a full assessment once when you have a fully assessed reference. This is one of the requirements for resource based payment Nigeria could aspire to GCF pilot. This opens opportunities for the country and not only to contribute to the Paris Agreement, but also to get payments for it if it shows to be successful on this implementation”, she added.<br /><br /><b>By Gabriel Ewepu</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Modernization of Agriculture Practices and Developing Countries",
    "content": "<br />Inorder to be develop, a country must have a working agricultural System that is able to provide the required food Product for it initial and growing population.<br /><br />In developed Nations such as the USA, UK, China, Spain, etc, there is always a system in play/road map that is meant to look into the agricultural sector, guiding its policies creation to empower and enable the farming/Ranching population achieve optimum production capacity.<br /><br />Some of these policies have lead to the use of modernize system of agricultural practices such as farm mechanization, farm power such as the solar panel power, windmill, etc, use of hybrid crops &amp; animals, use of machnaries such as the milking machine, harvester, Ridger, irriagation system, fenching, Tagging, Branding, Tracking etc.<br /><br />In developed countries, it is required that all individuals, company, or business should have a defined physical boundry(fence) of their properties and structures to avoid encroachment on properties, confusion &amp; conflicts. This also apply to Agriculture and it practices.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6b72kiDXNts/WdcyXDd2k6I/AAAAAAAAAQY/NOstYdHAKhUNv6xZXeGgUayH9QECSi0UgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Agricultural%2BTechnology.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6b72kiDXNts/WdcyXDd2k6I/AAAAAAAAAQY/NOstYdHAKhUNv6xZXeGgUayH9QECSi0UgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Agricultural%2BTechnology.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Farmers who have farmland and grows their crops are advice to practice fencing to restrict access of farmland &amp; secure the food or cash crops from individuals or animals that will do it harm or consume them unneccessary. Also notice are meant to be placed on the fence warning individuals not to cross into farmland or bear the consequences.<br /><br />Animal husbandry specialist or Ranchers who rear animals like cattle, Sheep, Ram, Goat, Pig, Grasscutters, etc, that are herbivoures and would do harm to farmland, have to restrict the herds to the grazing land or Barn using fences. Also all animals are require to either be tag or bear the brand of their owners, for easy identification.<br /><br />In most developed countries it has gotten to the stage where by the plant is supplied water direct to their root and the water is regulated such as the drip irrigation system used in Isreal this is very useful when the water source isn't enought to go arround. while in Animal husbandry, the herds of cattle, sheep, ram, goat, pig or grasscutter are restricted to barn and grasses and water are brought to them each animal have its own pen in the barn house.<br /><br />Some of these practices though costly are very effective in helping develop countries meet their much needed production capacity, it also help in preventing some minor conflict such as \"farmer herders\" clashes as a result of farm animal encroaching on farmland &amp; stealing animal(animal rustling).<br /><br />Another modernized practise that help in farming is the use of mechanized farming to cultivate more land and produce more. Most of these equipment maybe too costly for the farmers to get on their own and will require the help of Government agencies to acquire them if possible produce these product.<br /><br />Indeveloping countries, Animal rustling is very common as people try to acquire what they havent help produce. The best way to check this is to make sure all owners of animals have their stock, tag, branded with their symbol or are under tracking. Use of a Tracking device is the most modern method of securing your animals it is cheap and much more accurate in ensuring animal rustler are caught.<br /><br />The only way these can work in developing countries is if their Federal and State Agricultural agencies put these features into laws and policies and enforce it. Till these are done there will still little hope of these developing countries meeting the Food production needs of their countries.<br /><br />There canc be no developed country if the do not have a developed agricultural system so as an Agriculturist away make the strive for innovation &amp; modernization of Agricultural Practices.<br /><br /><b>Odogbor Oghenefejiro</b><br /><b>AgricventuresNG</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Government will continue to work and provide the enabling environment,” the president said.<br /><br />He said unlike in previous governments where trucks conveying fertiliser would miraculously disappear in transit, none of the 3,333 trucks used for the programme last year went missing.<br /><br />“I want to assure all participants of the PFI that, we will continue to provide adequate security so that this programme, and its positive impact on Nigeria, is sustained,” Buhari promised.<br /><br />On the partnership between the Central Bank of Nigeria, the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and governors to ensure Nigeria feeds itself, he said: “I want to encourage you to continue on this track. Specifically, you must all support programmes like the PFI and work together to ensure we never return to the dark days of import dependence. I am pleased to hear that already, the CBN is working with the commercial banks on programs that will further expand and enhance the PFI.”<br /><br />He called for the availability of fertilizer for farmers in the South this rainy season and urged the Ministry of Finance and NSIA to engage the Governors Forum to conclude their orders.<br /><br />Buhari directed the CBN to work with the commercial banks to ensure affordable capital for farmers and agro dealers.<br /><br />He also challenged others involved in the value chain to play their parts: “The NSA and the security agencies should be ready to allow and protect the movement of all agricultural goods. Specifically, issues relating to end user certificates must be prioritised.<br /><br />“The NPA should provide all the necessary support required to expedite the offloading and evacuation of the imported materials.<br /><br />“And finally, the NSIA and FEPSAN, under the able leadership of the Governor of Jigawa, must ensure quality and affordable fertiliser is available to farmers at the right time.”<br /><br /><b>By: Oluwatosin Alalade&nbsp;</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />As the World Wildlife Day was celebrated on March 3, there have been calls from government quarters for the public to support the Nigeria National Parks Service and the work they do.<br /><br />However, Director of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Studies, Obafemi Awolowo University, Professor Emmanuel Ofoezie, has said responsibility lies on the Federal Government to improve funding of the National Parks Service for national parks in the country to thrive.<br /><br />He noted that the parks in existence today were the ones which had been long established in the period close to the nation’s independence.<br /><br />“It is a national ecological function for National Parks Service to safeguard animals and plants in their natural habitat and limit human activities in those areas, and allow them remain in their natural state. The national parks that exist are the one that were created before and immediately after the country’s independence.<br /><br />He noted that these parks were now being encroached on, but pointed out that “most importantly they are highly underfunded.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7BhCQDnnfn0/Wp6QDMCqGBI/AAAAAAAABLo/-ZHKblowIzEjGjmsVKHj74gMApq2K9BkgCLcBGAs/s1600/Wildlife-elephants.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-7BhCQDnnfn0/Wp6QDMCqGBI/AAAAAAAABLo/-ZHKblowIzEjGjmsVKHj74gMApq2K9BkgCLcBGAs/s320/Wildlife-elephants.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />It is a very important aspect of ecosystem management. If you go to Kenya and visit their national parks, that is where you will find these threatened animals and near-extinction animals. But in Nigeria here, they are highly underfunded to a point where they cannot identify the plant and animal species found in the parks. There are supposed to be plants that are found inside those parks that have become extinct elsewhere.”<br /><br />He said the underfunding issue had made it impossible for them to employ the needed experts or support any kind of research in this regard.<br /><br />Professor Ofoezie said, “By now, one would have expected that at least in every state, you will have a park reserve area for plants and animals. But they remain the number the they were established years ago.”<br /><br />There are eight national parks of Nigeria. The Nigeria National Park Service (NNPS) is responsible for preserving, enhancing, protecting and managing vegetation and wild animals in these national parks. They are located in Borno, Cross River, Adamawa, Kwara, Edo, Oyo, Bauchi and Kaduna.<br /><br />He concluded saying, “It will be very interesting to see our government pay more attention to our national parks; not only to establish new ones but to see the already established ones prosper. Proper funding will enable them employ the required staff and engage in some good research.”<br /><br /><b>By Paul Omorogbe</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Agriculture as defined is what people do both scientifically and as an art to produce food for mans use. Nigeria in Speaking is a verily blessed nation with a lot of Agricultural potentials ranging form crop production to Animal husbandry.<br /><br />Still, the Nation is plague with a lot of food insecurities and crises Arising from mismanagement of scarce resources and poor enabling environment. when we look at mismanagement of resources we see the very fertile lands and rivers in Nigeria where there is little agricultural practices as result of communal crises such as the herdsmen clashes with the farmers and the cattle rustling of herdsmen cattle this is the current state of Nigerian Agricultural System.<br /><br />Agriculture is not just a way of life of people, it is also a means of livelihood and improvement in standards of living. So when there are Crises in the much needed Agricultural sector then there is no way of life for some people and their means of livelihood and standard of living is affected.<br /><br />These individuals whose life have been so altered by these communal crises such as the herdsmen attack and cattle rustling find their self declining in their standards of living and eventually can't afford the basic social amenities such as good drinking water, good roads, electricity, education, healthcare or event the right to live their life as they want to, they are always in constant fear of threats to their lives &amp; properties as regards to their farming ventures.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVStvEaCN90/WlR9RZnLkcI/AAAAAAAAA-4/APYKO9ZgsEwxYsnbXoCrYlDc8Ms14Wo1QCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Pastorialist-%2BFarmers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"371\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVStvEaCN90/WlR9RZnLkcI/AAAAAAAAA-4/APYKO9ZgsEwxYsnbXoCrYlDc8Ms14Wo1QCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Pastorialist-%2BFarmers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Federal and State Government abilities to provide enabling environment for these Agriculturist practicing farming and animal husbandry has been a key issue in the development of Nigeria's Agricultural Sector. These enabling environment includes;<br /><br /><ul><li>good road that links to farms and markets</li><li>security of our produce both,\"both plants and animals\" and one that causes damage to the produce have to bear the cost of that produce,</li><li>processing &amp; storage facilities there are so many agricultural products that goes bad as not way to preserve and store them,</li><li>availability of serviceable loans with moderate interest rates such as the anchor borrowers program</li><li>poor extension service, the Federal and State government has encourage much extension services for the pass decade as a result the extension field is dying out which is cause for alarm,&nbsp;</li><li>poor appointment of agricultural staffs, we are in a country where under qualified staffs are appointed to a post they know much about which leads to their out right failure or poor performance of the sector such as appointing someone who didn't read agriculture to be a minister of agriculture or when extension services are needed and instead of agricultural extension workers being employed to further this service, Agricultural economics workers or marketers are employed for these job. it is best to appoint the best fit for the position.</li><li>lack of good technology to implement modern day agriculture such as tractors, water sprinkler system, milking machines, tracking devices, ridgers etc.</li></ul><br /><br />Recent Solution such as cattle colonies/Ranching or Anti-grazing law that are established in some states are possible solutions but it has to be started no Agriculture is a business as well as life&nbsp; and no one is meant to bear the cost for another persons business. if anyone or state government want to create a cattle colony or put in place law to restrict cattle colonies it is good but it should be done right and not at the cost of the state and the lives of its citizens. We are all citizens of a state and our benefit and well-being should be considered first before that of Animals and Plants.<br /><br />One solution which have not been considered and maybe cheaper is tracking. The farmers once they plant can not move their crops because they are stationary while the headmen are dynamic moving form region to region with their cattle's, if all the farms along the routes are tracked as well as the herdsmen &amp; and their cattle. There by placing the routes of the farmland of the farmer of limits to the cattle herds. it will make it easier to control, investigate, and plan out possible routes that lead out of the farmland and if any herdsmen ventures into a farm land investigation can be quickly and effectively carried out and result backed with tracking evidence.<br /><br />This i feel is much cheaper and less stress than the continuous clashes of farmers and herdsmen happening in mos part of Nigeria...<br /><br /><br />Odogbor Oghenefejiro<br />Agricventures.Ng<br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Directors and heads of organisations have been urged to leverage on prospects the agriculture sector brings with its potential for creating wealth to grow the economy as well as tackle the growing unemployment in the country.<br />A fellow of the Institute of Directors and Chairman, Best Food Group, Emmanuel Ijewere, insisted that 75 per cent of Nigerians can earn their means of livelihood in the agriculture sector if properly explored.<br /><br />He explained that most Nigeria erroneously believe that agric sector is about farming only, adding that farming constitute only 5% of entire agriculture chain.<br /><br /><br />Ijewere, who was the guest speaker at the institutes’ February 2018 new members’ induction, spoke on the theme, ‘A Director in an Uncommon Industry’, submitted that agriculture which created major source of employment was left as soon as Nigeria discovered oil.<br /><br />The fellow who was a former president of the institute said: “Directors are champions and captains of industry. The assumption then was that agriculture was just farming, but today farming is just 5 per cent of agriculture. In the past 20 years, agriculture has become 90 per cent science and 10 per cent strength and energy.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--QOwDa3sOM8/Wp5io4WEFJI/AAAAAAAABK4/9cCTKjToAmYvVsNk_sK10Aj3CvRWEBipgCLcBGAs/s1600/Agriculture.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--QOwDa3sOM8/Wp5io4WEFJI/AAAAAAAABK4/9cCTKjToAmYvVsNk_sK10Aj3CvRWEBipgCLcBGAs/s320/Agriculture.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />To be able to achieve that you must have educated people. Some of the most educated we have in our country today are serving in boards of companies, they are shareholders in companies, they are decision makers, risk takers, therefore they should move towards agriculture value chain but not necessarily just farming, in so doing they’ll be creating a better country for Nigeria.”<br /><br />Expressing optimism that the bill before the National Assembly for the chartership of the institute would soon be realised, the President and Chairman of governing council, IoD Nigeria, Ahmed Rufai Mohammed, disclosed some of the institute’s plans for the year which include the beginning of a robust and well-grounded advocacy programmes that will be based on good research and analysis in 2018.<br /><br />To achieve this, Mohammed said IoD would engage government so as to influence policy contents and directions towards creating a more business-friendly environment.<br /><br />He added that the institute and Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE) have an on-going collaboration to train directors of companies listed on the exchange and to bestow annual corporate governance award on best compliant company.<br /><br /><b>By Gloria Ehiaghe</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />In line with the Presidential directive for making fertiliser available and affordable for the average Nigerian farmer, Indorama Eleme Fertilizers &amp; Chemicals Limited, a major producer of urea fertilisers in the country have confirmed their plan of increasing urea fertiliser production to 750, 000MT this coming farming season.<br /><br />The company’s head of sales and marketing, Dr S K Srivastava, in an exclusive interview with Daily Trust, said the company was also in agreement with the federal government under the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative (PFI) for the supply of urea for production of NPK (20:10:10) fertilisers.<br /><br />“Yes, this year also we have an agreement with the FG under the PFI and we are most likely starting the supply of urea from this month,” he said.<br /><br />The head of sales and marketing also noted that there would be a boost in the amount of urea the company intends to supply the Federal Government, from 180, 000MT supplied last year to 360, 000MT this year for the production of NPK (20:10:10) fertilisers.<br /><br />Dr Srivastava commended the FG for the Presidential Fertiliser Initiative because farmers have reasonable monetary savings on the farming input.<br /><br />“Remember the price of NPK was more than N7, 000, N8, 000 like that, but under this scheme farmers received this NPK at N5, 500 so there’s good amount of savings in terms of money,” he stated.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

K is getting wasted so we are saying if you’re going to apply NPK apply it basal so that you have maximum utilisation of fertiliser.”<br /><br />He stressed the company’s commitment on farmers training, noting that in 2016, they trained nearly 200, 000 farmers, which they plan on increasing to 330, 000 farmers this year.<br /><br />Similarly, he revealed that the company also plans on training farmers on climate change adaptation strategies and agribusiness as well, in addition to ways they can get better yield and income from their produce, when to store, how to store, when to supply and whom to supply.<br /><br />Dr Balbir maintained that all Indorama agronomists have soil testing kits and offer free soil testing for farmers who bring their soil samples.<br /><br />He also said every agronomist has a projector which he/ she could use to show farmers some movies or pictorial presentations.<br /><br />According to the head of sales and marketing, Dr S K Srivastava, the company also offers free training to its traders, agro-dealers and retailers because they are change agents and farmers come to them first for advice.<br /><br />Singh blamed the very low levels of fertiliser consumption, wrong timing of application as part of the reasons for relatively low yield levels farmers get in the country.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Malawi's New Reality: Fall Armyworm is Here to Stay",
    "content": "<br />By now, anyone with a link to agriculture in Africa has likely heard of the fall armyworm (FAW), a pervasive agricultural pest native to South and Central America that has ruthlessly worked its way across nearly the whole of the continent, after arriving in West Africa in early 2016 and making its way south of the Sahara and into Malawi by December of that same year. FAW has spread quickly due to its short reproductive cycle and ability to travel long distances quickly in the adult (moth) stage.<br /><br />In Malawi, FAW poses a significant threat to smallholders and the nation’s food security as a whole, following a devastating cycle of natural disasters in the past two years. While FAW feeds on more than 80 plant species, including cash crops such as cotton in the country’s Salima district, its attack on staple crops sorghum, millet, and especially maize—Malawi’s primary staple crop and food source—is especially worrisome.&nbsp;<br /><br />According to Jean-Pierre Busogoro, an agricultural scientist with the European Union delegation in Lilongwe, “a healthy crop resists pests better than a stressed crop.” Unfortunately, Malawi’s maize-dominated mono-cropping system—with its uniform plant tissues and populations—does not include the natural barriers that diverse, intercropped plant tissues have, making it vulnerable to aggressive pests like FAW that expand and flourish quickly.<br /><br />Damage from FAW in Malawi has been significant. As of Feb. 1, estimates show that 382,000 hectares of maize, sorghum, and millet have been affected nationwide, impacting more than 1 million farm families, according to Albert Changaya, controller of Agriculture Extension and Technical Services at the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development (MoAIWD). Roughly 10 percent of this years' dry season (non-irrigated) maize is expected to be lost to FAW, double last year's damage, MoAIWD data show.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6fD5OxvCr4I/Wp0SoycSdEI/AAAAAAAABJ4/v55rqbA4gJI3Ll61yLk366cmytnaiugHQCLcBGAs/s1600/push-pull_malawi.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"646\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"129\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6fD5OxvCr4I/Wp0SoycSdEI/AAAAAAAABJ4/v55rqbA4gJI3Ll61yLk366cmytnaiugHQCLcBGAs/s320/push-pull_malawi.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><b>Immediate response</b><br /><br />Based on infestation rates, which vary across the country and have surpassed 80 percent in some hotspots, the Government of Malawi has prioritized pesticide distribution as an immediate response, and, along with development partners, has provided some pesticides for free to farmers. It is also providing training in pesticide use, as most smallholders have never used chemical pest control. According to the latest fourth Integrated Household Survey (IHS4), only 2.3 percent of all plots had either herbicides or pesticides applied in the 2015/16 agricultural seasons.<br /><br />However, this approach has­ some limitations. The basic economics of pesticide use, according to George Phiri, an entomologist by training and assistant representative for programme at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), indicate it is best to spray when at least 10 to 20 percent of plants are infested. Their efficacy can also vary considerably based on the timing and method of application, dilution rates, and the stage of its life cycle at which the pest is sprayed.<br /><br />Phiri said that training is essential for farmers to scout their fields and assess the severity of the damage, and make their own decisions about how best to handle the pest. The government’s distribution program is limited, so in many cases, that won’t be with pesticides—the cost of which is generally prohibitive for smallholders.<br /><br />The possible environmental and health risks of chemical control of FAW are another downside. Not only is applying pesticides costly, but it is potentially dangerous for people and the environment.<br /><br />In addition to the procurement and distribution of pesticides, much of the initial FAW response has focused on creating awareness among farmers, extension workers, and supporting agencies. Farmers are being deluged with sometimes contradictory information. For those who do use chemicals—whether purchased from agrodealers, distributed for free, or subsidized by the government and NGOs—many receive different messaging on how to apply them, leaving plenty of room for human error, meaning chemicals may be misapplied and workers exposed.<br /><br />According to Dimitri Giannakis of Farmers World, one of the largest suppliers of farm inputs in Malawi, most formal and informal agrodealers are not specifically trained in helping farmers choose the best pest control approach, nor are they able to evaluate the relative effectiveness of the chemicals they sell. In response, Farmers World created a Farm Services Unit to train formal agrodealers in their network to properly advise farmers and to help them weigh the costs and benefits of spraying.<br /><br /><b>Moving beyond the short term</b><br /><br />While chemical pesticides certainly have a place in the immediate response, these problems illustrate the dangers of relying on pesticides alone. So the government has a plan for large-scale adoption of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach, which combines its near-term emergency measures with longer-term strategic approaches.<br /><br />“There is no single solution for FAW control,” Busogoro said. “We need to understand the interaction between pest and crop, and we need an integrated strategy,” to promote a healthy, resilient, and nutrient-rich crop environment containing pests’ natural enemies.<br /><br />In the longer term, an IPM strategy is affordable and accessible for the majority of farmers. It can also help deliver consistent messaging on best agricultural practices. Busogoro favors working through farmer field schools (FFS) to address pest management because it is a participatory extension approach that involves farmers in both technology development and assessment as well as ‘’learning-by-doing.”<br /><br />Adoption of good agronomic practices, including timely planting before FAW populations build up, is an integral part of dealing with FAW in the long term, Phiri said. He stresses the need to promote vigorous early plant growth coupled with early detection and treatment of FAW, as the older a crop gets, the lower the chances of successful pest control.<br /><br />The use of intercropping and more diverse cropping systems can also help slow the spread of FAW and other pests and diseases by providing a barrier of non-compatible plant tissues that may not be edible to the pest, Busogoro said.<br /><br />One intercropping technique that has proven particularly successful in controlling FAW is the “push-pull” approach. Originally developed to control the cereal stemborer, another pervasive pest, push-pull involves intercropping a cereal crop (like maize) with insect-repellent legumes of the Desmodium genus, along with an appealing forage plant, like Napier grass. The legume repels or “pushes” pests away from the primary cereal crop while the grass serves as an enticing border that “pulls” them away.<br /><br />A push–pull field showing maize intercropped with silverleaf desmodium and with Napier grass planted as a border crop (left); climate-adapted push–pull field showing sorghum intercropped with drought tolerant greenleaf desmodium and Brachiaria cv mulato II as a border crop (right).<br /><br />Learning from neighboring countries’ control methods for the stemborer as well as successful local control of African armyworm (from the same genus Spodoptera as FAW) can be useful. Since 2014, the Malawi government has worked with FAO to build capacity at the community-level to monitor and predict outbreaks of African armyworm in hotspots. The system is considered effective and can serve as a model for FAW monitoring and early warning.<br /><br />The MoAIWD also plans research on various other solutions, such as understanding the impacts of conservation agriculture on FAW population dynamics and damage, and the development of local capacity for FAW biological control using effective parasitoids and predators, although they currently lack the necessary funds to do so.<br /><br />Sometimes, less is more. The simpler and more accessible a solution is, the more likely it is to be taken up and sustained in the long term, well after external funds and subsidies cease. As Busogoro suggests, FAW—and other pests and diseases—can ultimately be neutralized if we focus on “simple technologies, adapted and accessible for the majority of farmers.”<br /><br />Kimberly Keeton is a Communications Specialist with IFPRI's Malawi Strategy Support Program (MaSSP).

    "content": "<br />Since setting her foot in Nigeria at 5am, 22 July 2008, to work for an NGO that was doing healthcare-related work in the North, Mira Mehta has seen agro-opportunities that will shape her entrepreneurial skills forever.<br />When she alighted from a British Airways flight that morning, she met with some Nigerians who have private sector-driven focused initiatives in Nigeria that will change her perception to also see prospects in every problem in the country.<br /><br />Mira Mehta is today the Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer Tomato Jos Farming and Processing Limited; a ccompany that started in 2014 with tomato cultivation in Panda, in Nasarawa State but the idea started earlier with what she saw travelling across the northern states.<br />Speaking with Daily Trust on Sunday in her farm last week, she said the idea came to her when during her development work she saw large quantities of tomatoes been dried by the roadside because farmers were unable to sell.<br />“That idea came to my head and at the same time I was learning how to cook Nigerian food, so I was making stew, jollof rice and every time I picked up a tomato paste, it’s made in China or somewhere else. So I asked; why can’t those tomatoes on the road be used to make stew?&nbsp; That was the genesis of the idea,” Mira stated.<br />After conceiving the idea, she went to a business school and began research to figure out the possibility of setting up a tomato farm and processing facilities in Nigeria, specifically finding answers to three questions: is it possible to do it economically, politically and operationally? “If the answer is yes to those questions, I will go into it completely,” she said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ruuni2M4chs/Wp0QA8iWCQI/AAAAAAAABJg/Bm26AlnQOe4GHtn4XGCPmVZO0Ows8kyMwCLcBGAs/s1600/Tomato%2BFactory.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"368\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"178\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ruuni2M4chs/Wp0QA8iWCQI/AAAAAAAABJg/Bm26AlnQOe4GHtn4XGCPmVZO0Ows8kyMwCLcBGAs/s320/Tomato%2BFactory.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><b>How the farm ended up in Kaduna</b><br />When she started the project in 2014, she went to 10 different locations in Kwara, Kaduna, Nasarawa, Plateau Kogi and then few places in Ghana.<br />Panda in Nasarawa which first hosted the company in a 10 hectare land is not considered as an ideal location for tomatoes agronomically, and from a farmer’s perspective, the farmers in Nasarawa State are not as advanced as the farmers in the North as far as irrigation or vegetable farming is concerned, but the first three seasons in the areas gave them the opportunities to prove their modules and then look for a permanent location to settle.<br /><br /><b>The choice of Kangimi location</b><br />According to her, when she started looking for land in 2015 and 2017, the Kaduna State government showed the strongest commitment to bring in the private sector.<br />“So they took me, within Kaduna alone, to 20 different locations in the northern part of the state. Every single location has access to water, and every location was near farmers who are already farming tomatoes at no cost to me. So I took that part of seriousness also seriously on my part and said, okay; these guys are willing to do this for me and I’m the smallest investor in the state. They really want this thing to work, so that is the reason we ended up in Kaduna state”, Mira stressed.<br /><br /><b>Why is the farm named “Tomato Jos”</b><br />Ms Mehta told the reporter how she came about the name; “the name came from two things: if you go to Mile 12 market in Lagos, the tomatoes from Jos have a higher price because they thought to be higher quality tomatoes then we said “Tomato Jos” will indicate the quality of our product.<br />“Two, we wanted to have a very Nigerian brand, a lot of the main leading brands in the country sound Italian, they don’t sound Nigerian but “Tomato Jos” instantly tells the&nbsp; story.<br />“Sometimes people asked me how is Jos and I had to say awkwardly well we are not in Jos. I wanted to be in Jos initially because most of my close friends in Nigeria are from Plateau. We are still connected to Jos because we are located along Jos road here.”<br /><br /><b>Size of the farm</b><br />The farm sits on 500 hectares of land. 35 hectares have been cleared but only 10 hectares will be cultivated this year, but by the dry season of 2018, its plans to cultivate the full 35 hectares.<br />“In 2019 we plan to cultivate 200 hectares and 450 hectares in 2020. We think this is the maximum we can go in this location because there are areas that are rocky. We are starting smaller than we wanted to, that’s partially because of the high cost in clearing the land, the water pump station, setting up of the irrigation system- we plan to use drip irrigation system- that cost run from 3,000 to 4000 dollars per hectare so you can imagine how much it will cost to do that in 500 hectares” the CEO said.<br /><br /><b>Capacity of the proposed plant</b><br />The company is looking at a 300 tonnes per day facilities of raw materials. “What that means is if we are producing for 90 days, we will produce about 4,000 to 5,000 tonne paste a year.<br /><br /><b>The tomato paste project</b><br />“We are planning to raise the funds for our own processing facilities by the end of this year. In the interim period we are working with a factory that is owed by the Kaduna state government in Ikarra LGA. We are working towards launching the brand through that facility by May this year. We want to launch the brand this year if we can but that factory is old so we want to make sure it can produce the right quality before putting my name behind it” Mehta noted.<br /><br /><b>The plant for the paste</b><br />The Ikara plant is owed by the Kaduna State government but lease to another private sector organization. TomatoJos has a relationship and agreement with them to produce the paste. They will pay the company cost plus 10% and they’ll produce the paste for the investor.<br />TomatoJos will however provide the raw materials, the packaging materials. According to Mira, the arrangement will “allow us to learn a lot about processing without having to own our factory; it will enable us to learn about the challenges with logistics. That factory is smaller than the one we want to build but even at that it will provide huge lessons to learn about logistics operations.”<br /><br /><b>Plans to survive in the market</b><br />The company boss reiterated that the reason why they are investing heavily in farming and so little in processing at the moment is to be sure if they can get the cost of production of tomato to N30 per kilogramme-that is N30, 000 per tonne then they can produce paste competitively with the imported products.<br /><br /><b>The outgrower scheme</b><br />The farm also operates two structures of outgrower schemes farmers from Mararaba Jos, Rohogh, Goro and Kangimi Villages at the Kangimi Dam site. The first is a group of 20 farmers cultivating 3 hectares and the second 15 module farmers with a quarter of a hectare each on the company farm.<br />The outgrowers received seed, fertilizer, chemicals on loan and a lot of very technical trainings. Farm sends extension agents to the outgrowers’ farms twice a week to see the farmers to monitor any change, any disease, pest and application fertilizer to reduce any leakage.<br />“We have tight control and heavily monitor system”<br />In exchange for that, the farmer returns a set volume of tomato at agreed farm price to pay back for their loans; anything above that the farmer decides whether to sell to them or the open market.<br />“Let say the value of the loan on the input is 18 tonnes of tomatoes, if the farmer is able to give us 18 tonnes of tomatoes is up to them if they want to sell to us or to someone else,” she said.<br /><br /><b>Tomato Jos’s 10years plan</b><br />Her dream for the farm in the next ten years is “have 10% market shares in the country. Ten percent of tomato sold and eaten in Nigeria would be tomato Jos brand. The factory and 500 hectares will be fully developed. We would have purchased additional land to continue our production, we will have expanded to 3,000 hectares or will have additional land in plateau state or another part of Kaduna state to continue our production, and we will have expanded the factory from 3000 to 2000 tonnes a day.”<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

The initiative is being sponsored by the Mitsubishi Corporation Fund for Europe and Africa and that the organisation is working in partnership with the Ondo state Ministry of Agriculture and education on the programme.<br /><br />He explained that with the support of the state Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, agricultural science teachers in the schools are trained by extension officers to serve as trainers within the schools for students.<br /><br />“By this we are building a sustainable network of agric educators. The initiative will be replicated in other schools across the state.” Also speaking at the launch, Jemimah Ibitokun, project coordinator, Farm to School Africa, said that with the training and the involvement of the students in the entire process of farming, their interest in agriculture would increase.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

The collaboration between Daily Trust and the Kebbi State Government is the first of its kind in recent years.”<br /><br />He said while the government was diversifying its economy to agriculture, Daily Trust was diversifying from news reporting to improving and encouraging food production in Nigeria.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAm0/5NJJ366GNgYifYf1qVv72Oj0kkoMbVPwwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"182\" data-original-width=\"278\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAm0/5NJJ366GNgYifYf1qVv72Oj0kkoMbVPwwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“Interestingly, those who are at the exhibition and interactive forum are Kebbi farmers and majority of the stakeholders are from Kebbi. This will assist government to provide the needed support for its farmers and suppliers and the enabling environment to increase their production.”<br /><br />He added that at the end of the year there would be collaboration between suppliers, manufacturers and traders of various farm produce in Kebbi State and Nigeria.<br /><br />“That is why LABANA is participating fully to ensure efficient food production for the development of the country. This is very encouraging, promising and it means we are gradually moving to the Promised Land by ensuring that we have enough food to feed the nation,” he said.

Debt is a serious burden which should not be taken for granted. We are taking steps and measures to ensure repayments. We are working in collaboration with EFCC, state governments as well law enforcement agencies including legal actions to ensure repayments”, he pointed out.<br /><br />Adamu hitherto said he bank was doing a lot to recover the loans “we are providing incentives to staff to enable them follow up recoveries. We engage recovery agents on commission and state mobile courts. It has paid off in some states where we recovered over N100 million. We will continue the recovery efforts”, he assured.<br /><br />He explained that the bank’s operations had been going through technological transformation with the introduction of automated data base to enhance and efficiently upgrade its activities as well capture relevant basic information and details of farmers and other direct and indirect beneficiaries of its intervention schemes and programmes.<br /><br />“It will effectively assist our lending procedures and processes because every farmer’s BVN , land as well a national data registry for collateral is now in operation against any default. If any default, no bank will grant you loan of any kind.<br /><br />“We have the Anchor Borrower, AADS, RiFAN, National Egg Production scheme among other intervention products”, he mentioned.<br /><br />According to the bank’s Boss, ” our focal target is to efficiently and effectively support small holder farmer strata, build the capacity of women, youths, create employment and empowerment windows and ensure value addition.”<br /><br />He however, said the capitalisation process by the bank from N10bn to N25bn was almost close to reality, explaining that “the two major players are the CBN with 40% and Ministry of Finance incorporated to raise 60% so that the operations of the bank can efficiently be strengthen&nbsp; as an institution.<br /><br />He explained that the bank was only commercially viable and sustainable to operate not as a profit oriented organ but to be efficient in value addition to the economy and stakeholders through various agriculture programmes<br /><br />“We track farmers, input suppliers as well processes through a responsive mechanism otherwise, Programme Monitoring Team drawn from CBN, BoA, MoA, MoF among other critical stakeholders.<br /><br />“I want to say that BoA is alive to its responsibilities and open to all agriculture associations for efficient services. We are set to take to the door steps of farmers. Our dream is to ensure genuine input are supplied, realise and exceed 500,000 targeted farmers for dry season”, he said.<br /><br />Meanwhile, in an earlier remark at an interactive session shortly after a brief sensitization workshop for Rice farmers on Input Distribution Biometric Model, Dr Adamu commended CBN for the continued support and show of concern to the need for boosting the country’s drive for self-sufficiency and security in food production.<br /><br />” I commend CBN for its dispassionate zeal and commitment through sustainable partnership in support of Mr President’s enviable policy which we hope to get to the promise land”, he said.<br /><br />He said BoA was focusing on mechanisation approach to improve on yields and rapid production capacity” will further ensure expansion on land use for accelerated agriculture scale in states of the federation. We have come up with a pilot programme that will guarantee us the window to open and operate an agriculture park through mechanisation.”<br /><br />In his presentation, a Senior Manager, Development Finance, Central Bank of Nigeria, Mr Musa Olasofu noted that the Northwest accounted for 80% of the total rice production of the country, thus remain the focal spot of the drive for food sufficiency agenda, while pointing out that input supply and distribution were the greatest challenges of the entire practical process of rice production under the schemes.<br /><br />According to him” the biometrics would assist in providing valid information on land size, required input as well encourage distribution sequence through mapped outlets thus improve yields with quality supplies”, he mentioned.<br /><br /><b>By: Adeyinka Akintunde</b><br /><b>Source: The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

That the paltry sum of $200 million when compared to what is being pumped into the oil sector is insignificant. The council recommended that at least about $1 billion be pumped into agriculture.<br /><br />“Council noted how Nigeria moved the budget from about N4 trillion to now about N8 trillion. It also noted that when this president came in… oil had nose dived from $112 in 2014 and in 2016, it was $30. in 2016 Council also appreciated the efforts of the Ministers of Agriculture and Budget and National Planning after their briefings, on the efforts they are giving to the president, and agreed they should continue in what they are doing.<br /><br />“The Council advised that planting should be done all year round and not only during planting seasons and that we should grow what we will need, what we will eat and eat what we will grow.

First is the real farmers/herdsmen clashes, where the normal herdsman moves around with his cattle and get into a farmer’s land and eats up his crops.<br /><br />“In some situations, it’s pure banditry. Some of the pastoralists that are not herders attack, steal and kidnap, and that has to be defined as such. Some of them rustle cattle and move into the deep forests, and because of the thickness of the forests, response are usually very difficult. That was also discussed today (yesterday) and solutions were proffered on how to get deep into the forests to check those bandits that hide and continue to commit havoc.<br /><br />“The third aspect usually classified as farmers/herdsmen clashes is also the settlers and indigenes’ clashes like in the Southern Kaduna. Some migrant farmers or herders stay in an environment for a very long time and when you have such clashes, they are also classified as farmers/herdsmen clashes.<br /><br />“So, we understand and acknowledge these three aspects, and all have different approaches in solving the whole problem. And from the discussions today, a lot has been done, solutions have been proffered and the government believes solution is near.<br /><br />“The Minister of Agriculture also presented a position on how to resolve the first part of the farmers/herdsmen crises. That is the actual migrating herdsmen that pass through towns and farms, eat up crops in the farms and create a lot of problems,” Badaru said.<br /><br />Also briefing, Anambra State Governor, Willie Obiano, said the council approved appointments of 23 members of National Population Commission (NPC) and unspecified numbers of Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) commissioners as well non-legal practitioners in the Federal Judicial Service Commission.<br /><br />Meanwhile, former President Goodluck Jonathan, former President Shehu Shagari, former Head of Interim National Government, Chief Ernest Shonekan, and former military President, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida (rtd) were absent from the meeting.<br />Present at the meeting were former Heads of State, Gen.Yakubu Gowon (rtd.), Gen.

The first was held on October 21, 2015, while the second took place in September 2016.<br /><br />The Council of State is an organ of the federal government saddled with the responsibility of advising the executive on policy making.<br /><br />Its duties include: advising the president in the exercise of his powers with respect to the national population census and compilation, publication and keeping of records and other information concerning the same; prerogative of mercy; award of national honours; the Independent National Electoral Commission (including the appointment of members of that commission); the National Judicial Council (including the appointment of the members, other than ex-officio members of that council); the National Population Commission (including the appointment of members of that commission).<br /><br />The council also advises the president upon requests on issues bordering on maintenance of public order among others.<br /><br /><b>By:&nbsp; Omololu Ogunmade</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why Nigeria Must Develop Castor Value Chain",
    "content": "<br />One of the agricultural commodities in which Nigeria has strategic comparative advantage in producing and processing in large quantity is castor seed. As a result of its industrial importance, there have been committed multi-disciplinary efforts aimed at promoting its sustainable development locally.<br /><br />The castor plant (Ricinuns communis) belongs to the family Euphorbiaceae. It is native to Africa as it is of Ethiopian origin. Due to its industrial potential, it is now found throughout tropical, sub-tropical and even temperate regions of the world. The plant is drought and pest-resistant and can be grown practically anywhere there is land.<br /><br />However, the plant is one of the most under-utilised biological resources in most parts of the tropics, including Nigeria.<br /><br />Also, despite the fact that castor is one of the most versatile plants being used in over 10 industries, not much research has been done on improving its value chain, hence its limited use as industrial raw material in the country as compared to other cash crops.<br /><br />At present, castor is grown in most states of the federation, albeit on small scale basis.&nbsp; The plant is grown in Abia, FCT, Bauchi, Benue, Ebonyi, Gombe, Kogi, Kwara, Plateau, Yobe, Cross River and Zamfara states.<br /><br />However, productivity is low under the farmers’ condition in Nigeria. While the yield under the best agronomic practices varies from 2.5 to 3 tonnes/ha per annum, productivity in Nigeria is between 0.3 to 0.7 tonnes/annum, limiting its availability for use as industrial raw material and profitability of its production under the farmers’ condition compared to other industrial crops. The current annual production is just about 12,000 tonnes per annum, while national production capacity exceeds 50,000 tonnes per annum.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VCWJq-RFrtY/WnrsFpUhl8I/AAAAAAAABEI/XZ8AQM5yBd4CuLakeAWMXxk1WHUHyDnmACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"214\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-VCWJq-RFrtY/WnrsFpUhl8I/AAAAAAAABEI/XZ8AQM5yBd4CuLakeAWMXxk1WHUHyDnmACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers.jpg\" /></a></div><br />In view of its versatility as an industrial raw material, castor seed development has become a global affair.<br /><br />China, Brazil, India and some other south America countries are prepared to import castor seeds as long as it meets the need of its industries.&nbsp; Importation of castor seeds by these countries is occasioned by the high level of development in the textiles, pharmaceuticals, oleochemicals, electronics, cosmetics and perfumes, chemicals, paper, food, plastic and rubber industries in the countries where castor seed oil and its derivatives are highly required.<br /><br />The Director General of the Raw Materials Research and Development Council (RMRDC), Dr. Ibrahim Husaini Dogo noted that the major industrial product from castor seed is the oil.&nbsp; The oil derived from the seed is a pale amber viscous liquid which turn colourless or yellowish after refining and bleaching. The beans contain about 30 – 50% oil, that could be extracted by either cold-pressing or solvent extraction process.&nbsp; Castor oil is unique among all fats and oils in that it is the only source of an 18-carbon hydroxylated fatty acid with one double bond and ricinoleic acid (12-hysroxyoleic acid) which comprises of approximately 90% of the fatty acid composition.&nbsp; Owing to the presence of hydroxyl group and high concentration of ricinoleic acid in castor oil, they are found valuable as a chemical feed stock.&nbsp; The oil have been found useful in some medicinal applications were it is effective in preventing the growth of numerous species of viruses, bacteria and yeast.&nbsp; It is also successful in treatment of ringwo<br />rm, skin inflammation, fungal infected finger and toenails.&nbsp; On its industrial applications, the presence of hydroxyl functional group enables it to react with isocyanate to produce polyurethane used for elastomers and adhesives.&nbsp; Castor oil has been successfully used in paint industries for the production of coating resin through its modification with other drying oil and also in lubricant production; largely, because of the unique properties that it possess.&nbsp; The oil has product uniformity and consistency which are relatively high for naturally occurring material.&nbsp; In addition, they are non-toxic, biodegradable and renewable resource.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dr. Dogo said more than N50bn was expended on the importation of castor oil and its derivatives for use in different industries.<br /><br />In view of the high industrial potentials of the seed across several industries, the RMRDC, in line with its mandate of promoting industrial utilisation of local raw materials and the development and adaptation of existing equipment by the industrial sector, found it imperative to promote production and value chain development of castor seed processing locally.<br /><br />Presently, the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR), Zaria, and the National Cereals Research Institute (NCRI) have mandates for castor seed development.<br /><br />While RMRDC is collaborating with these organisations, it is also exploring international opportunities for castor seed development in Nigeria.<br /><br />In recognition of the need to develop local castor varieties, RMRDC collaborated with Efugo Farms, owned by Chief Audu Ogbe, to carry out multi-locational trials on indigenous castor varieties in Nigeria.<br /><br />To further increase castor seed yield in Nigeria, the RMRDC supported the National Research Institute for Chemical Technology (NARICT), Zaria, to import improved castor seeds from Israel. The seeds were distributed to castor farmers in Adamawa State for the 2016 planting season.<br /><br />More recently, farmers were able to supply 16 tonnes of castor seeds for processing at the Efugo Farms Castor Plant in Kuje, Abuja, Nigeria.<br /><br />The council, in line with its mandate, has drawn up a more pragmatic programme that will make the collaboration with Efugo Farms, FMITI and the Castor Producers, Processors and Marketers Association (CPPMA) more effective in 2018.<br /><br />On the international scene, the council has been collaborating with Kong Associates Shaghai (China) Limited to promote the development of varieties that can be grown in the tropics for optimal production of seed and oil.<br /><br />Also, the council, in 1995, imported 40 tonnes per day of castor oil plant that was installed in Kaduna. The plant is the pioneer castor oil processing plant in Nigeria. It has been able to attract investment in castor oil production in Nigeria.<br /><br />Today, there are two other castor processing plants operating locally. The council is further studying the value chain of castor seed to promote its optimal development.<br /><br />To ease the drudgery associated with castor shelling, the council imported two castor shellers in 2017. One was given to the members of CPPMA, while a consortium of local engineers is currently working on the design and fabrication of the other machine locally.<br /><br />According to the result obtained from the study by experts, castor value chain in Nigeria is comprised of six principal players: input suppliers who supply the farmers with planting materials and technology, the farmers who perform all the production and harvesting, the processors who buy the seeds to extract the oil, the marketers and exporters who buy and sell the castor seed, oil and cake and the end users.<br /><br />Although production and processing are still low, with promotional activities by RMRDC and other government agencies geared towards creating awareness, providing planting materials and modern processing technology, there are signs of growth in the sector.<br /><br /><b>By Hussein Yahaya&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "CBN’s Tech Strategy for ‘Anchor Borrowers’, Cleaner Notes",
    "content": "<br />As part of efforts to improve the operational efficiency of the Anchor Borrower’s Programme (ABP), the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has introduced technology to guide input distribution of farmers under it Anchor Borrowers Programme. The pilot phase, flagged off at the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), last week, was meant to build a national data base for small holder farmers, enhance efficiency of input distribution and eliminate ghost farmers.<br /><br />The Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, while speaking at the flag off ceremony for this year’s farming season, said the biometric information of the farmers had been taken, their farms mapped and biometric cards produced for each farmer, which would identify them while collecting the inputs from the service providers.<br /><br />His Special Adviser on Agriculture, Olatunde Akande, who represented him at the event re-emphasised that service providers had already mapped all the farmlands to be used for this season in order to avoid false claims by the participating farmers.<br /><br />He noted that the FCT farmers would be used to try the technological innovation introduced into the ABP, adding that the process will spread across 24 states that are participating under the Rice Farmers Association Nigeria (RIFAN)- ABP dry season.<br /><br />The governor later flagged off the input distribution exercise with 10 farmers from Abaji, Bwari and Kuje Area Council, using their biometric cards, as a test run to what can be accomplished by effective technology.<br /><br />The inputs distributed included water pump, NPK fertilizer, organic fertilizer, urea fertilizer and herbicide. The service providers also presented tractors that would be used for ploughing and harrowing. All these inputs form part of the total loan due to the farmer, thereby eliminating the old way of disbursing cash directly to the farmers.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QBRb22OtHKI/Wo1S3zmsRLI/AAAAAAAABF4/isdO1htl8SQvejekklB0ITeDLn-2yDafwCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmer%2Bon%2BTomato%2BFarm.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"721\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-QBRb22OtHKI/Wo1S3zmsRLI/AAAAAAAABF4/isdO1htl8SQvejekklB0ITeDLn-2yDafwCLcBGAs/s320/Farmer%2Bon%2BTomato%2BFarm.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Note that the strategy is not just about reducing cash transactions, but as already acknowledged globally, digital innovations are fast enthroning a regime of transparency and accountability, as well as reaching the expected target.<br /><br />The representative of the Managing Director of the Bank of Agriculture, Emmanuel Ameh, urged the farmers to make judicious use of the inputs, as a way of reciprocating the efforts of CBN.<br /><br />The President, RIFAN, Alhaji Aminu Goronyo, thanked Emefiele for his leadership and commitment to ensuring that Nigerian farmers are empowered to contribute to economic development and urged all RIFAN members to take advantage of this opportunity as it marks a new beginning for funding small holder farmers in Nigeria.<br /><br />The input distribution anchored by the trio of the CBN, BOA, and RIFAN would continue throughout the week in the North Central states of Niger, Kogi, Nassarawa and Benue. Other zones will commence in succession, according to the roll out plan.<br /><br />Similarly, the complaints about dirty and unfit notes in circulation are not new, because at a certain point in the banking industry operations, the over-the-counter and Automated Teller Machines’ transactions expectedly, became the outlet for dirty notes that were mixed with new notes.<br /><br />Two bulk tellers from two banks told The Guardian that they have the discretion to sort out dirty notes and even reject them when customers come with them, because “if you collect unfit note, it would be debited against you,” yet these financial institutions were one of the disbursers of the near unfit currencies in circulation.<br /><br />According to Wiki, “currency changes hands constantly” and one never knows where the money in ones’ possession has been, particularly banknotes, which has the tendency to build up grime and may be loaded with bacteria. Notes collect dirt and discoloration from the germs that rub off of people’s hands. Of course, not minding how careful one is, our own local unit- Naira, can easily be put to unfit condition.<br /><br />Still, a report by The Atlantic, while discussing the causes of notes’ mutilation, noted: “You might have noticed that it’s pretty hard to find any cash printed much earlier than the 1990s in circulation. Just as more money is constantly being created, it’s also constantly being destroyed. Who are the destroyers of money, and how do they do it?”<br /><br />Of course, this is about the nation’s local currency (naira notes) being physically destroyed or put out of crisper condition. But how? For example, majority of Nigeria’s auto parts dealers, market women and teeming Okada riders (on aggregate level) are leading the pack. This is mostly fueled by literacy level and lack of confidence in the alternatives (technology) as most transactions are cash-based. Sometimes, you make withdrawal to pay them, only for them to go back and remit the same money in their accounts.<br /><br />While the argument that Nigeria has gone far in the adoption and use of technology, perhaps by the level of literacy, particularly by the market women and traders in major enterprise hubs, cutting edge solutions are now being developed and made available in the country.<br /><br />For the past five years, CBN, under its longstanding Financial System Strategy 2020, has pioneered several initiatives aimed at reversing the trend that has eaten deep into government coffers- cost of replacing unfit notes. The most notable of these initiatives is the cash-less project, which at present, has cut across sectors of the economy.<br /><br />In the banking sector particularly, the move has strengthened innovations leading to speedy clearing of cheques. Besides the Internet banking, mobile banking (use of phones in full banking transactions) has been advanced. Still, for many who cannot afford “smart phones” for the full mobile banking, now have alternative in the technology embedded in Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD), also known as Quick Codes.<br /><br />These are aimed at reducing dependence on cash, saving the available notes and cutting down on the budget associated with replacement of unfit notes in circulation.<br /><br />Besides, these offer Convenience, as they can be executed at the comfort of the home or elsewhere and any time, thus eliminating the barriers of closed operations during holidays and weekend. This is the benefit of going digital and aligning with the CBN’s strategy. Of course, this will bring end to queues at ATM points.<br /><br />In fact, the Chief Executive Officer of Outlook Asia Capital, once told Economic Times that these technological innovations track spending. That is the second benefit. It also helps to pay the exact amount of bills, saving the challenges of looking for change or forfeiting it to shopkeepers who nowadays will always tell their customers that there is no change.<br /><br />While the campaign to embrace the technological innovations ongoing in the financial system, it is incumbent on all to give it a trial. There can be no end to dirty currencies in the system as long as financial transactions are involved and people continue to patronise vendors of various goods and services. But there can always be reduction in the level of unfit notes in circulation. The secret is patronizing the alternative solution- the digital payment system, which encompases Point of Sales and electronic transfers.<br /><br /><b>By Chijioke Nelson</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

It almost had a backlash as it led to a hike in the price of the staple food in many homes. However, before long, the quality of the export was called to question as consignments were rejected in Europe and America.<br /><br />But Irtwang assured that the second export would not attract publicity as the flag-off had already been celebrated last year, adding that the exporters and the technical committee were also mindful of the Export Prohibition Act.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZuqOyr-3fM/Wehd6FoxvdI/AAAAAAAAAew/YjaFakzYeYIYxfM-In-JPuGaxxBECgLCACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Yam.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZuqOyr-3fM/Wehd6FoxvdI/AAAAAAAAAew/YjaFakzYeYIYxfM-In-JPuGaxxBECgLCACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Yam.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said until the Act is repealed the committee and yam exporters will carry out the export quietly, adding that the committee was in touch with the companies that produced cartons for packaging the yams and those that received them abroad.<br /><br />According to Irtwang, having learnt from the challenges of the first consignment, the committee was hopeful that the second one would achieve 100 per cent success. “Not all species of yam are good for export. So, yam farmers and traders need to know the species that are good for export.<br /><br />“They also need to know how to select, store and preserve them to increase their freshness and ability to stay long without decaying.<br /><br />“We also have to let yam farmers know the seed yams they will plant that will be good for export,’’ he said.<br /><br /><b>By: Okwy Iroegbu-Chikezie</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Chemically treated seeds need to be washed thoroughly before planting<br />• For natural pest control, organic farmers may use mixture of natural ingredients like neem and other natural bio-pesticides<br />• Mulching is also a common practice in organic farming<br />• Mechanisation and the use of heavy machinery for farming operations is highly discouraged in organic agriculture.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News&nbsp;</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />…farmers yet to sell last year’s harvest<br /><br />Many farmers are forecasting a fall in the quantum of maize production this year for one reason: massive importation. They said this has led to a fall in the price of the locally produced variety.<br /><br />Cheap auction maize importation from the US, Ukraine and other countries has already taken a toll on Nigerian farmers as it has crashed the price of maize produced locally.<br /><br />In addition, some stakeholders in the industry believe some feed processors abuse the window the Federal Government provided as intervention and imported more maize than they needed.<br /><br />Daily Trust investigation across maize-producing states revealed that farmers have surplus maize yet to be sold in addition to poor price; something that many said will discourage them from massive production this season.<br /><br />In most parts of Yobe State, 100kg bag of maize is sold between N9000 to N9500, as against over N14,000 sold the same time last year.<br /><br />The story is nearly the same in Sokoto where a 100kg bag of maize sells between N11,500 and N12,000 as against last year’s price of N14,000.<br /><br />A farmer and grains dealer, Malam Abubakar Dange, attributed the situation to a glut of the produce as some of the companies that usually buy maize in large quantities in the area no longer do so.&nbsp; <br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fcjD6km9SuQ/WdZA0sI4BOI/AAAAAAAAAKE/WckV4gS1mpQ5Wckzt4P54ZvFhPyZ_ul_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Maize.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-fcjD6km9SuQ/WdZA0sI4BOI/AAAAAAAAAKE/WckV4gS1mpQ5Wckzt4P54ZvFhPyZ_ul_wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Maize.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />In Kogi, a check by Daily Trust at the Lokoja&nbsp; International Market indicate that the cost of maize has crashed down greatly when compared to that of last year.&nbsp;<br /><br />A maize trader, Mrs Teni Wakili told our correspondent that a 100 kg bag of maize which sold between 17,000 and N17,500 last year now sells between N10,000 and N10,500.<br /><br />Teni complained that customers were not coming despite the cheap price of maize.&nbsp;<br /><br />The situation in Kaduna, one of the largest producers, is worst as the price has collapsed from N14,000 to N8,000 per 100kg.<br /><br />The chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) Kaduna State Chapter, Alhaji Nuhu Aminu, said, “It is unfortunate that the price of maize has dropped compared to how it was sold last year 2016/17. Many farmers however cultivated a lot of crops thinking the price will remain high.<br /><br />Our correspondent in Makurdi reports that a 100kg bag of maize presently sells for between N11,000 and N12,000 in markets across the state capital of Makurdi as against between N18,000 and N17,000 which it was sold at this time last year.<br /><br />Our investigation in Kano also revealed that grain markets in the state are currently flooded with maize because of supply from Niger, Katsina and Kaduna states - something Alhaji Danliti Muhammed, a trader attributed to large production.<br /><br />However, Alhaji Abdulrasheed Magaji Rimingado, chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN) Kano branch, opined that huge importation of maize from foreign countries crashed the price of the commodity in the local market and rendered a lot of farmers helpless as they couldn’t compete with the price of the imported variety.<br /><br />Alhaji Rimingado stressed that the imported produce has made market price unfavourable to the farmers, as 100kg now sells at N11,000 as against N16,000 sold last year.<br /><br />“We were told that, the market is presently expecting about seven ships loaded with maize into Nigeria. The AFAN leadership both at state and federal levels have made several attempts to intimate the authorities concerned on the dangers of such move,” lamented the state AFAN chairman.<br /><br />In Jigawa, Katsina, Niger and Nasarawa states, Daily Trust&nbsp; findings showed the price of maize is presently between N9,500 and N11,000 as against between N13,000 and N19,000 in 2016/17 season.<br /><br />One of the notable farmers in Funtua, Katsina State, expressed fears that if the price does not improve, it might discourage farmers from growing the commodity this year.<br /><br />Malam Isah Mahmud, one of the farmers in Sabon Wuse, Niger State attributed the drop in price to high production of maize last year.<br /><br />Farmers in the state also attributed the unfavourable price to massive production of maize last year coupled with the activities of grains importers.<br /><br />Experts who spoke with daily Trust maintained that the country must take steps to sustain the success recorded in agriculture in the last few years.<br /><br />Dr Aliyu Samaila, an agric economist, explained that while the price of a 100kg bag of maize was currently between N9,000 and N9,500, the same bag cost N3,800 three years ago, and still a welcome development for the farmers.<br /><br />&nbsp;“You had to sell two bags of maize to be able to buy a bag of fertiliser, but now you sell a bag of maize and buy a bag of fertiliser and still have surplus which means there is progress,” he said.<br /><br />The expert pointed out that Nigeria was producing about 10 million MT in 2010 but production dropped to about 7 million MT, with companies like OLAM factory in Kaduna alone requiring about 300, 000MT per annum.<br /><br />Sources within the Olam company admitted that the company and some others used the window period provided by the government to import maize for birds consumptions last year but that they had since stop in line with the federal government’s directive.<br /><br />Another agric expert, Dr Hakeem Ajeigbe, maintained that Nigeria had the capacity to produce its maize requirement.<br /><br />“If we want to keep our people employed in agriculture, then we have to protect them and one of the ways to do that is to reduce importation except if we want to provide jobs for people in other countries,” he stated.<br /><br />&nbsp;The expert advised government to peg custom duty on maize importation at 100% in order to stimulate production and protect local farmers.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A Yusuf &amp; Safina Buhari (Abuja), Rakiya A.

We have about 250,000, who have also cultivated close to 300,000 hectares of farmland, and you can see the impact on the street.”<br /><br />The RIFAN president said that unlike in the past when the ABP partnership was between the CBN and state governments, a private sector-driven initiative had been launched to drive the programme.<br /><br />He stated that under the programme, partnership between the CBN, RIFAN and 200,000 farmers would be given fresh funds to plant rice in the dry farming season and another 500,000 farmers in the wet farming season.<br /><br /><b>By: Ifeanyi Onuba,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Stakeholders decry double digit interest rate on NIRSAL loans for farmersNigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with RIELA, German agricultural technology company, to tackle estimated N2.7 trillion annual post-harvest losses in the country.<br /><br />Signing the agreement in Abuja on Sunday, the Managing Director of NIRSAL, Mr Aliyu Abdulhameed, said the move was in line with the organisation’s mandate to ensure sustainable value chain-driven solution in agriculture.<br /><br />Abdulhameed said the partnership would provide increased access to harvest and post-harvest technology equipment, to help farmers at the production level with technology, training, machinery and technical assistance.<br /><br />According to him, we believe that this multi-level support will improve farmers’ productivity and increase their income in grains, fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />The managing director quoted the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) as saying that the country loses over 51.3 million tonnes of food annually to post-harvest losses across agricultural products, describing the development as unacceptable.<br /><br />He said the partnership was a business-driven service provision and support framework that would provide farmers at the primary level of production, cost-effective access to modern farming technologies and machinery.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMQQBe8_Rp0/WdzPymfLTVI/AAAAAAAAAR8/3fsK9lJeErYALMrz830cWVrgCmPLxAIdACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/NIRSAL.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMQQBe8_Rp0/WdzPymfLTVI/AAAAAAAAAR8/3fsK9lJeErYALMrz830cWVrgCmPLxAIdACPcBGAYYCw/s320/NIRSAL.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The managing director listed some agricultural equipment that would be available through the partnership to include threshers, aspirators, stationery and mobile dryers, steel silos.<br /><br />Others are storage equipment, cooling devices, milling and mixing plants for feed production as well as packaging solutions, adding that all the equipment would be designed for the Nigerian environment.<br /><br />‘‘As a country, we are blessed with the production of various agricultural commodities, but the post-harvest loss rate is quite alarming.<br /><br />‘‘The majority of our farm produce is lost to pest and deterioration. This is fundamentally caused by poor post-harvest processing and storage practices.<br /><br />‘‘These losses are much higher in the rural communities where most of our primary production activities take place.<br /><br />‘‘Our approach in NIRSAL is to look at the agricultural value chain from inputs, mechanisation, primary production, harvest, post-harvest processing and storage all the way to market.<br /><br />‘‘RIELA will also provide the equipment and a 12-hour back-to-work repair system and after-sales service networks in proximity to customers.<br /><br />‘‘NIRSAL, on its part, will facilitate necessary financing required for the partnership from our local financial institutions,’’ he said.<br /><br />In his remarks, the German Ambassador to Nigeria, Mr Bernhard Schlagheck, said the German Government was supporting the partnership between NIRSAL and RIELA.<br /><br />He said the support was in line with Germany’s confidence in the direction of the Federal Government’s agricultural diversification policies.<br /><br />Schlagheck described the prospects of the Nigerian agriculture sector as very promising given the innovations of NIRSAL.<br /><br />The Managing Director of REILA, Prof. Karl-Heinz Knoop, said the company was in Nigeria to make agribusiness viable to ensure that harvested agriculture produce were properly packaged and stored.<br /><br />‘‘I can imagine the pains of farmers in Nigeria and this is the reason why we want to help; we want to address this agricultural problem with Nigerian solution.<br /><br />‘‘The partnership is not to sell machines and disappear; there will be services and guarantee on what is sold.<br /><br />‘‘We will train farmers on how to handle these machines,’’ he explained.<br /><br />News Agency of Nigeria reports that NIRSAL was incorporated in 2013 by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) to improve lending to agriculture by addressing the underlying reasons why banks do not lend to the sector.<br /><br />NIRSAL has also, in the past three years, facilitated nearly N63 billion in commercial bank lendings to agriculture.<br /><br /><b>Source: Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigeria’s Cattle Rearing Politics: A Colonial Legacy",
    "content": "<br />Nigeria is today engulfed in a boiling conundrum over the menace of Fulani cattle herdsmen, who as it seems, are engaged in stiff competition with the Boko Haram insurgents for a boisterous position in the infamous acts of terrorism.<br /><br />Declaration by the Federal Government that the insurgents are by no means terrorists and its demand from the state governments to surrender their lands to the Fulani for grazing reserves, what it euphemistically termed “cattle colonies”, reveals the grave national tragedy waiting to explode. The cattle rearing politics is a legacy of the colonial administration, contextualized within the framework of agricultural policies since 1921. The genesis is traceable to the memorandum of 1921 which blueprint divided the Colony and Protectorate into arbitrary boundaries in accordance with ecological differentiation. It delineated the arid Northern Savannah and their southern fringes for pastoral production which consisted of Zebu and Gudali cattle in addition to export of cotton, groundnut and hides and skins.<br /><br />The last item alone was valued £3.75 million in 1949. The Middle Belt was designated for food production in spite of the fact that it had large supplies of the trypanotolerant Ndama cattle stock. The palm belt zone was mapped out for export of palm oil and kernel notwithstanding that Igboland reared sizable number of Muturu – the indigenous dwarf, shorthorn tsetse resistant cattle. The Southwestern provinces were assigned with the export of cocoa and palm produce. It is worthy of note that in spite of the cynical reservations of fellow administrators who advanced the argument that the policies were incoherent and in a state of flux, they were adopted by all the directors of Agriculture: O. T. Faulkner, (1921-1936), J. R. Mackie (1936-1945) and A. G. Beatle (1945-1954 .<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kN0CJyZ0N1A/WmhYU1gNYVI/AAAAAAAABBA/X9jIozwRpwkTzyRfqctS35zGaj7xpba-gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/cattles.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"359\" data-original-width=\"480\" height=\"239\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-kN0CJyZ0N1A/WmhYU1gNYVI/AAAAAAAABBA/X9jIozwRpwkTzyRfqctS35zGaj7xpba-gCPcBGAYYCw/s320/cattles.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />While busy carrying out boisterous propaganda on Southern and Middle Belt trypanosomiasis for which reason it discouraged livestock development in these places, the regime worked assiduously on the elimination of epizootic diseases in the North, which rinderpest constituted the worst menace, causing heavy economic losses since 1895 when it was first reported. Through wurin aiki – rinderpest camp sites established in each province since 1920, recumbent Fulani cattle were inoculated and the disease was successfully extirpated. In 1924, veterinary laboratories were established at Vom, a tsetse-free territory in Jos, to combat major epizootic diseases.<br /><br />Fodder crops and grazing methods were developed and in pursuance of the fiscal policy of cattle taxation, the government frowned at the close-knitted practice of the nomadic Fulani cattle herders, who somewhat restricted their business to the North. It encouraged them to spread their cattle marketing southwards so that the benefits of Nigeria’s livestock would not remain the prerogative of a single tribe.<br /><br />In any case, epidemiology of Cyclorrhapha tsetse flies otherwise called Glossina spp. was nationwide. While the South had a prevalence of Glossina Palpalis and G. tachinoides varieties, the North had in addition, G. Pallicera, G. hanningtoni, G. tabanifomis plus the most widespread and deadly G. fusca, found mostly in Niger, Kabba, Kaduna, Adamawa etc. Similarly, while the poisonous blood-sucking black flies of the simuldae family were prevalent in the Northern zone, they were rare in the Eastern and Western provinces. When it made a brief appearance in Oji River near Enugu in the early 1960s, its eradication programme was immediately carried out using DDT miscible.<br /><br />In the North, eradication of tsetse flies commenced with the 1925 Kaduna Tsetse Conference, which culminated in the setting up of a joint veterinary and medical investigation centre at Gadau, north of Azare in1930. In 1948, the West African Institute for Trypanosomiasis Research (WAITR) was set up in Kaduna to serve the West African sub-region. In 1960, its name changed to the Nigerian Institute of Trypanosomiasis Research (NITR), with its activities still restricted to the North. The Federal Ministry of Health also operated sleeping sickness centres for the human angle of the disease, again restricting its services to the Northern states. By 1951, over 50, 000 cattle were treated per annum, by 1957, the figure had shot up to 770, 000. However, by 1960, only some 794 km2 of grazing land had been freed of tsetse infestation, increasing to over 500 km2 by the late 1970s. Unfortunately, as effort was limited to extension services and research, no government initiative was geared towards introducing the Western idea of ranching.<br /><br />The counterproductive effect of the colonial agricultural policies on the entire nation became manifest during the Second World War when widespread hunger and malnutrition became the lot of the people, rich and poor alike, and manifesting more in protein and vitamin deficiencies.<br /><br />It was worsened by prohibition order on the importation of a wide range of foodstuff from Europe including meat, milk and beverages. But the Fulani became the beneficiaries. Ban on cheese and butter imports led the government to kick-start the production of clarified butter fat (CBF) at Vom and Kano. Network of milk collection centres were established throughout the North and output rose from 90, 000 to 136, 000 kg of butter per annum and 22, 500 and 27, 000 kg of cheese.<br /><br />The Fulani made good business by supplying the raw materials in the form of cream from which CBF was obtained through hand-driven centrifugal separators. Small dairy schemes also developed in Okene (Kabba Province) and Jakiri near Bamenda in the Cameroons then under Nigerian suzerainty. The booming business, however, ended abruptly at the end of war when better quality products started coming from Europe.<br /><br />In any case, the wartime Fulani boost continued. Cattle Multiplication Centres (CMCs) also called ‘Fulani Treatment Centres,’ established throughout the Northern Provinces engaged in crossbreeding of local species with exotic equivalent to produce pure Friesian breed.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It could be seen that the colonial livestock policy created disunity and sowed the seeds of today’s wrongful notion by the Fulani that they alone are endowed with monopoly of cattle rearing business. The report of Nigerian Livestock Mission from London led by Thomas Shaw and Gilbert Colvile (Sir Frank Ware) in 1949 did not fail to indict the colonial administration on the matter, accusing it of exaggerating the tsetse situation in the South. It was not until the Oliver Lyttleton Constitution of 1954, which introduced federalism with regional autonomy, that the Southern provinces for the first time established their own ministries of agriculture with rudimentary research and extension services.<br /><br />Dr. Adinuba, a Lagos based Agro-Industrial Projects/Investment consultant, writes via adinubabenna@gmail.com<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR) of Ahmadu Bello University (ABU), Zaria on Tuesday said it had introduced innovative measures that would boost and sustain cowpea production in Nigeria.<br /><br />The project was tagged ‘Taking Cowpea to Scale in West Africa - Nigeria’, is meant to engage West African countries of Mali, Ghana, Senegal and Nigeria in the modern methods of cowpea production under the sponsorship of USAID.<br /><br />Professor Ibrahim Umar Abubakar, the Director of IAR, said farmers selected for the programme were given threshers and grinders.<br /><br />He said the Innovation Platforms (IPs) were introduced to ensure the continuity of the cowpea production project even after the departure of the sponsors - USAID.<br /><br />He added; “Continuity is the watchword; continuity is what we want, we want farmers to keep on participating in the project. We don't want the project to die. Innovative Platform is a platform that we have collated all the stakeholders into a particular unit, so that even if the project is off, the activities can still continue with the stakeholders.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KU2voZAK7a4/Wn1hxzsFoGI/AAAAAAAABEk/8ngwJcUvDPI3xyrn4iDpDkfC4CVBcziqQCLcBGAs/s1600/USAID.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"255\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"123\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KU2voZAK7a4/Wn1hxzsFoGI/AAAAAAAABEk/8ngwJcUvDPI3xyrn4iDpDkfC4CVBcziqQCLcBGAs/s320/USAID.jpeg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“The platform is divided into three platforms so that the information can go round. The farmers in each state of Kano, Sokoto and Katsina can benefit enormously from it.<br /><br />“When you grow cowpea, processing is very important. It is not just enough to grow cowpea and say you have a very high yield. The question is what do you do with the yield? You have to reduce the feed losses and it can only be reduced when appropriate processes are being done; one of such is threshing.”<br /><br />In his speech, the coordinator of the project, Dr. Nafi'u Abdu, said the aim of the project was to promote wide scale adoption of improved cowpea varieties that were of high quality.<br /><br /><b>By Isa Sa’idu,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Food Security: Local Rice Production to the Rescue",
    "content": "<br />The involvement of states in rice production is boosting the Federal Government’s policy on the diversification of economy from oil to solid minerals and agriculture.&nbsp; DANIEL ESSIET writes on how local rice production has not only reduced capital flight but crashed the price of the commodity.<br /><br />After training as an economist in the University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom (UK), Rotimi Williams came to Nigeria on a visit His destination was Nasarawa State, where he was attracted to rice production.&nbsp; He decided to give it a try.<br /><br />Today, Williams farm – Kereksuk Rice Farm – is one of the largest commercial farms not only in Nasarawa State, but in the country.<br /><br />He explored technologies on how to become a successful rice grower and since then, there has been no looking back. Though he spends a lot on irrigation, he records good returns at the end.<br /><br />Despite the hitches, including as labour shortage, depleted soil cover, pest attacks and lack of marketing infrastructure to sell the produce, he has become famous in rice production.<br /><br />The collateral effect of the unending clashes between itinerant herders and farmers in neighbouring Benue State notwithstanding, Williams has become a part of the rice revolution in the country.<br /><br />The growing interests of individuals and corporate organisations in rice production have a long-term and sustainable future for thousands of young and old folks.<br /><br />According to government sources, about 15 million metric tonnes of rice were produced locally last year,<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCWJq-RFrtY/WnrsFpUhl8I/AAAAAAAABEI/yjNbUyCsc7Ai0NWWhJlVV-cHVv-XZrwFQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Farmers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"214\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VCWJq-RFrtY/WnrsFpUhl8I/AAAAAAAABEI/yjNbUyCsc7Ai0NWWhJlVV-cHVv-XZrwFQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Farmers.jpg\" /></a></div>Making the claim at the inauguration of the Rice Millers Association of Nigeria (RIMAN) in the state, the Director of Agriculture in the Kano office of the Federal Ministry of Agricultural, Muhammad Adamu, said that in Kano alone, 1.2 million metric tonnes of rice was produced in 2016.<br /><br />Although the Federal Government has set a 95 per cent self-sufficiency target in rice, only 50 per cent of rice consumption is currently being met locally.<br /><br />A whopping N365 billion of the government’s hard-earned resources goes into rice importation, The Nation learnt.<br /><br />The question on the lips of many is: “Why spend such huge amount of money on rice importation when the country has the potential of growing enough rice to support her growing population and generate surplus that can be exported?”<br /><br />The tonnage of rice being produced in the northern states of Katsina, Kaduna, Zamfara, Jigawa and Sokoto, is insufficient for the estimated 180 million population.<br /><br />But more states governments are buying into rice farming, as some state governments have acquired thousands of hectares of land to boost rice production in their respective domains.<br /><br />The states include: Anambra, Niger, Jigawa, Kebbi, Sokoto, Cross River, Ebonyi, Lagos, Delta, Kwara, Kogi, Anambra and Ogun.<br /><br />As of the last count, only two out of the 36 of states are yet to embrace rice production. Many of the states now plant thrice yearly.<br /><br /><b>Kano</b><br /><br />Governor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje said his administration is proritising rice cultivation. He told reporters in a chat of his plan to replace the age-long groundnut pyramids with rice pyramids.<br /><br />Besides, rice, Ganduje assured his administration will continue to provide the right environment to encourage massive production of rice, wheat and tomatoes.<br /><br />He assured that rice farmers would be provided with said with incentives to increase production.<br /><br /><b>Kebbi</b><br /><br />In the Northwest state of Kebbi, rice production has become a success story. The government has earmarked about N10 billion for the establishment of a rice mill.&nbsp; The production capacity of the proposed mill is 100,000 tonnes annually. It will be complimented with silos with capacity to store 18,000 tonnes of paddy and a warehouse for storing additional 12,000 tonnes of paddy.<br /><br />The facilities are expected to generate direct and indirect employment for 3,500 people and its procurement will reach out to 50,000 farmers.<br /><br /><b>Katsina</b><br /><br />Going by its claim, Katsina State Government has sunk N200 million into rice and cotton production under the Anchor Borrowers Programme.<br /><br />Governor Aminu Masari’s Special Adviser on Agriculture, Dr. Abba Abdullahi, told reporters in Katsina:&nbsp; “We have rice and cotton farmers that collected the CBN loan under the Anchor Borrowers Programme to boostrice and cotton production and the programme needs supervision.<br /><br />“We used the funds to supervise and inspect all the rice and cotton farms in the 34 local government areas of the state.<br /><br /><b>Ogun</b><br /><br />Ogun State Commissioner for Agriculture, Mrs Adepeju Adebajo identified agriculture as one of Governor Ibikunle Amosun administration’s cardinal programme.<br /><br />She said a lot of investment had gone into the sector since the inception of the administration.<br /><br />According to her, the administration is encouraging the production of indigenous variety OFADA. She said the government will leave no stone unturned to promote and improve the production of OFADA brand.<br /><br />The commissioner added that the production of Nerica 8 and Faro (short and long grains) varieties would be promoted to domesticate in the Gateway State, the Economic Recovery Growth Plan (ERGP) launched last year by the Federal Government to reboot the economy.<br /><br />The state, through direct intervention and assistance from development partners including: World Bank through FADAMA and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), assisted Value Chain Development Programme (VCDP), has recorded a quantum leap in rice production.<br /><br />Apart from the direct public sector supported intervention, the efforts of other private sector smallholder farmers in various farmlands across the state have all contributed to the success story.<br /><br /><b>Imo</b><br /><br />The Imo State government is taking a cue from Lagos State as it has announced a plan to go into a partnership with Kebbi State. Its Governor Rochas Okorocha said that such partnership has become imperative to tackle the prevailing economic situation. According to him, the partnership programme would majorly be in rice production.<br /><br /><b>LAKE Rice</b><br /><br />The brand name is derived from the partnership between Lagos and Kebbi states. At the inception of his administration, Governor Akinwunmi Ambode struck a a rice production deal with his Kebbi State counterpart, Atiku Bagudu. The result of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed by the two states in Lagos on March 23, 2016, on the production and distribution of rice, is the LAKE Rice which has become a household name in Centre of Excellence and some parts in the Southwest.<br /><br />At the signing, Governor Bagudu said: “Nigeria cannot afford to continually depend on imported rice. What we are doing is to pioneer a collaboration that will bring other states on board later as we believe that our potentials are enormous and we must have pacesetters to start that process of joint collaboration for our collective good.”<br /><br />His host said: “Lagos is the largest consumer of food commodities in the country by virtue of its large population. The state has the market with the required purchasing power. The state has an estimated consumption of 798,000 metric tons of milled rice per year which is equivalent to 15.96 million of 50 kilogram bags with a value of N135 billion per annum.<br /><br />“We have the economic prowess to produce rice locally. The era of imported rice is gone. The reality is for all of us to embrace the consumption of local food and commodities. Lagos State presently consumes 6,000 heads of cattle daily which may increase to 8,000 in the next five years.”<br /><br /><b>Anambra</b><br /><br />The story has changed for Anambra State, which was producing only 80,000 metric tonnes of rice per annum. “We have since tripled that production volume”,&nbsp; Governor Willie Obiano said, adding “from a yield of 244,235.25 metric tonnes of rice that we achieved in 2016, we have increased our production output to 322,000 metric tons per annum.<br /><br />“With this achievement, we have effectively surpassed our annual consumption figure of 320,000 metric tons in the state. We are not relenting. We are waiting for more investors. The Committee on Land Acquisition has earmarked 67,000 hectares of land that will be given out to big farmers who want to set up large mechanized farms in Anambra State.”<br /><br /><b>Kogi</b><br /><br />The Kogi State government has renewed its commitment to embrace the Federal Government’s policy on agricultural revolution policy. It Governor Yahaya Bello said the commitment has begun to yield positive results, assuring that its rice will soon bridge the gap between demand and supply across the nation.<br /><br />Bello’s media aide Kingsley Fanwo said in Lokoja during an appraisal of the state government’s agricultural plan that “we are poised to strengthen our lead in cashew production as well as take over the leading role in cassava and rice production, because of our comparative advantage in these crops. Kogi State has declared a state of emergency in the agricultural sector long before the unstable revenue generation in the state. The visionary administration has placed agriculture on the front burners of its economic prosperity plan known as the New Direction Agenda.<br /><br />“A massive revolution is going on across the state in the area of rice production. Kampe Omi Dam Project is breathing down on the leading rice producers in the country.&nbsp; Our rice mill is near completion and by the end of the year, the nation will be shocked by the magnitude of work put in place to ensure rice sufficiency in the country.<br /><br />“We are also working on the Ibaji Rice Farm, which has the potential of causing a revolution in the nation’s rice production. We attach great importance to the value chain and the multiplier effect agriculture can have on the economy of our dear state.”<br /><br /><b>Ebonyi</b><br /><br />Ebonyi produces over 1.2 million tonnes of rice annually. The state has 72, 000 hectares for rice plantation with a target of six tonnes per hectare production.<br /><br />The government said it has borrowed N10 billion from the Federal Government to finance agricultural activities.<br /><br />Its Governor Dave Umahi said the loan would be used to support farmers, especially, those involved in rice production.<br /><br />He said the state plans to establish mega rice cities in the various local government areas to boost rice production.<br /><br />Umahi said: “We want to domesticate rice production in Ebonyi State and we are going beyond individual production.<br /><br />“We are now beginning to see how we can institute what we call rice mega cities in each local government area where by we have 5,000 hectares of land dedicated for rice production in each of our local government areas.<br /><br />“Already, we have four rice mills that are in operation and you also see private people that are milling with their traditional machines. We are planning to cultivate 100,000 hectares of land to produce 400,000 tonnes of rice in the next two years.<br /><br /><b>Benue</b><br /><br />The Benue State government accounts for 1.5 million metric tonness of rice to reduce the national rice consumption deficit of 4.3 million metric tonnes.<br /><br />Governor Samuel Ortom said the state is working to meet the national food supply needs.<br /><br /><b>Nasarawa</b><br /><br />The Nasarawa State government is collaborating with the Pakistani Government on the production of basmati rice production and new rice seedlings have been procured from Pakistan.<br /><br />Governor Umaru Tanko Al-makura broke the news at the fifth combined convocation of Nasarawa State University. He said: “New rice seedlings from Pakistan have been procured and I have already directed the commissioner of agriculture to start experimenting on the possibility of Nasarawa becoming a basmati rice producer as our efforts to add value to the system.”<br /><br /><b>The power of commercial rice production</b><br /><br />Farmers in Kebbi and Lagos are leading the way in commercial rice production, benefiting from new seedlings and marketing opportunities that have helped them to overcome climate stresses and fend for their families.<br /><br />The partnership between the states has helped rice farmers to adopt better crop varieties, use water more efficiently and adapt to climate change.<br /><br />It has also promoted post-harvest technologies like rice milling and packaging, processing activities and stronger links with input dealers and micro-finance institutions.<br /><br />The project gives households opportunities to raise their income by developing new rice-based products like rice flour and husks for fuel and exploring the use of rice in fortified foods, including vitamin-rich cereals.<br /><br />With renewed government interests in the rice production sector in recent years, Lagos has the potential of becoming a rice granary.<br /><br />But, making this a reality requires the strengthening of rural infrastructure including roads, irrigation and milling and processing facilities, as well as boosting the farmers’ ability to market their produce.<br /><br /><b>Impact of states’ involvement</b><br /><br />The President, Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria, Aminu Goronyo, said annual rice production in Nigeria has increased from 5.5 million tonnes in 2015 to 5.8 million tonnes in 2017.<br /><br />He said that in 2015, Nigerians spent below N1 billion on rice consumption, adding that while spending has drastically reduced, consumption had increased because of increased local production of the commodity.<br /><br />“The consumption rate now is 7.9 million tonnes and the production rate has increased to 5.8 tonnes per annum.’’<br /><br /><b>Goronyo said, adding “the nation is making reasonable progress”.</b><br /><br />According to him, the annual rice production in Nigeria has increased, attributing it to the&nbsp; CBN’s Anchor Borrowers Programme(ABP) with a total of 12 million rice producers and four million hectares of FADAMA rice land.<br /><br />Since the introduction of the programme, many states have created economic linkage between smallholder farmers and reputable large-scale processors, thereby increasing agricultural outputs and significantly improving capacity utilisation of processors.<br /><br />To stakeholders, the involvement of states in rice farming could take millions of Nigerians out of poverty and reposition the economy.<br /><br />Speaking on the development, the Project Director of Cassava Adding Value for Africa Phase II (CAVA II) Project, Prof. Kolawole Adebayo, predicted an overall increase in rice production.<br /><br />He said: “Younger and commercially-oriented farmers will be encouraged to go into rice production. Nigeria‘s rice production potential will be boosted. Value chain opportunities supporting rice production will also contribute to the nation’s economy.”<br /><br /><b>Mandate for growth</b><br /><br />According to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), the value of importation has declined by 83 per cent within the last three years from N107.7 billion in 2014 to 17.9 billion in 2016, NBS data state.<br /><br />The numbers of rice mills (both integrated and cottage) have increased by more than 50 per cent as the government and private sector continue to make more investments in processing.<br /><br />The average crop yield per hectare of the crop has risen from 2.5 metric tonnes per hectare to an average of four and five metric tonnes of the same acreage, owing to renewed government commitment.<br /><br /><b>The Anchor Borrowers’ Programme</b><br /><br />The ABP, launched by President Muhammadu Buhari on November 17, 2015 in Kebbi State, is targeted at creating a linkage between anchor companies involved in the processing and SHFs of the required key agricultural commodities.<br /><br />The fund was from the N220 billion Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) Development Fund. The ABP evolved from series of consultations with stakeholders, comprising federal ministry of agriculture and rural development, state governors, millers of agricultural produce and smallholder farmers to boost agricultural production.<br /><br />Goronyo said that under the ABP, RIFAN in the next 24 months would commence rice importation to West African countries as the necessary arrangements had been put in place.<br /><br />He said: “For self-sufficiency, adequate and enough paddy for production ABP, which started in Kebbi state has been extended to 26 states. As a step further, RIFAN is in collaboration with some agencies to replicate the CBN APB programme in some states to increase production.’’<br /><br /><b>Local rice production: $600 million saved</b><br /><br />A whopping $600 million (about N216 billion) is believed to have been saved from the importation of rice alone from Thailand and other countries since the nation’s domestic mass production flooded the markets under the ABP.<br /><br />Agriculture &amp; Rural Development Minister Audu Ogbeh said rice imports from Thailand had dropped from 644,131 metric tonnes to about 21,000 metric tonnes between September 2015 and September last year.<br /><br />Echoing him, Information Culture &amp; Tourism Minister Lai Mohammed, said: “In fact, the Thailand Rice Exporters Association has recently revealed that within a spate of just two years – From September 2015 to September 2017 – Nigeria’s rice importation dropped from 644,131 Metric Tonnes to just about 21,000MT.<br /><br />“There is more good news to report: As a result of this administration’s success in local production, some investors from Thailand have shown interest in establishing rice milling plants in Nigeria, and this is sure to further boost rice production in Nigeria.<br /><br />“Four investors from Thailand are already in discussion with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture to establish rice milling plants in Nigeria.<br /><br />“You must understand that the investors from Thailand are here because they have lost over 600000 metric tonnes of imported rice into the country and it is a good decision to participate in what is happening here.<br /><br />“A few years ago, this would not have been possible since Nigeria was not considered a top rice producing country. Today, Nigeria is one of the largest producers of rice.”<br /><br />The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) predicted Nigeria’s rice imports to fall by 500,000 tonnes to 2.5 million tonnes in 2016, from the previous year’s imports of three million tonnes. The USDA post also forecast that rice imports will drop further by 400,000 tonnes to 2.1 million last year.<br /><br /><b>The challenges</b><br /><br />It is not yet Uhuru for local rice production. The bottlenecks at the ends of the production chain have not been totally eliminated.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />As Nigerians bemoaned the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) recent report indicating over four million job losses in 2017, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, has assured Nigerians that there was no cause for alarm. According to him, over seven million jobs were created in the various villages across the country at the same period.<br /><br />Ogbeh, who pointed out that there is no difference between income made in the cities and the villages, disclosed that the Federal Govenment’s economic diversification programme anchored on agriculture has put money in the hands of farmers, making many of them millionaires.<br /><br />This, perhaps, is the case for the beneficiaries of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda Support Programme Phase-1 (ATASP-1) in Anambra and Enugu states, as silent agricultural revolution is going on in communities in the South-East states where the African Development Bank (AfDB) funded programme is taking place.<br /><br />The programme, an AfDB contribution to agricultural development in Nigeria, is being implemented in five other states for five years (2015-2019).<br /><br />The Federal Government in partnership with the AfDB in 2015 launched the ATASP -1 with commodity value chain development alongside infrastructure development as some of its key components in four Staple Crop Processing Zones (SCPZs).<br /><br />The four staple crop processing zones are Adani-Omor, in Enugu and Anambra states; Bida-Badeggi in Niger State, Kano-Jigawa and Sokoto-Kebbi, covering a total of 33 local government areas.<br /><br />Specific objective of the project is to identify and promote science-based solutions for rice, sorghum and cassava value chains through technology production and distribution of quality seeds and planting materials strengthened by well-built seed systems.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VCWJq-RFrtY/WnrsFpUhl8I/AAAAAAAABEE/UuzBm7QheN0n00rq9MK4OV_1STjWjIhpQCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"214\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-VCWJq-RFrtY/WnrsFpUhl8I/AAAAAAAABEE/UuzBm7QheN0n00rq9MK4OV_1STjWjIhpQCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmers.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Target groups are smallholder farmers mainly youths and women trained by IITA, Ibadan, AfricaRice and ICRISAT along the value chains and assisted with improved technology to record good yield in their farms and product development skills.<br /><br />In Adani, Enugu State, Daily Sun met Ndidigwe Ekene, a young graduate who has benefited immensely from the ATASP-1 initiative, haven received training on farming after his national youth service programme.&nbsp;<br /><br />The young rice farmer said that from the way his fortune has changed, he would have no business looking for white-collar job again:<br /><br />“Formerly, we used to broadcast rice, but with the intervention of ATASP-1 and with the help of Africa Rice, I adopted a new approach which has significantly increased the yield. What I used to get before the ATASP-1 intervention was 11 to 12 bags (of 130kg each) after broadcasting, but now I’m getting above 15 during the rain-fed and quantities we used to get are higher during the dry season.<br /><br />&nbsp;“I don’t think there is any work that can make me stop farming unless you send me out of this country to where I cannot see land but once there is land there, I will continue farming. What I have here is one hectare, but I will like to expand my business to at least 10 hectares.”<br /><br />Another farmer, Bernard Idu, said the tonnage had dramatically increased following the improved technology and the seeding system training he received from ATASP-1.<br /><br />Farmers in the area also applauded the seed multiplication skills they imbibed from the trainers.&nbsp; A group of 21 youths trained in both cassava and rice seed multiplications said the initiative has changed their view of farming and also equipped them to make more money.<br /><br />Spokesman of the group, Ogwuda Ugochukwu, a 31-year-old graduate of Zoology and father of two, explained that they co-owned eight hectares where they produce seed, adding that they are already linked to an off-taker.<br /><br />Aside rice and cassava, it was gathered that the ATASP-1 programme has for the first time introduced sorghum farming among the Mbu community of Udenu Local Government Area of Enugu State and the people are seeing huge potentials in the crop.<br /><br />One of those who have keyed into sorghum farming in the area is 29-years-old Ugwuagbo Anthony who until now saw sorghum as something of no interest. He told Daily Sun in the farm that the programme has introduced four new varieties of sorghum (SK 5912, CSR 01, SAMSORG43) for trials and all showed good prospects as observed in the farms.<br /><br />It was gathered that the project has arranged an off-taker for the farmers when massive production is up-scaled next season just as many other farmers in their farms are poised for sustained cultivations.<br /><br />Changing face of agriculture<br /><br />Aside the farm initiatives, rural infrastructure like roads, markets, water and clinics were built across all the benefiting local governments in the participating states-some of the projects especially those in Orumba North in Anambra State are 90 per cent completed.<br /><br />In Ogbunka, Orumba South, a clinic and water projects have been done for the community.<br /><br />According to the National Coordinator of ATASP-1, Haruna Akwashiki, 14 clinics are being constructed in the programme areas: “Two clinics are ready for commissioning. The remaining ones are at various stages of completion. A total of 52 potable water supply and sanitation facilities are being constructed. But 10 are ready for commissioning. Fourteen community produce markets are being constructed. Four Technology Demonstration Centres are under construction. Twenty eight primary schools are at various stages of completion.<br /><br />“Presently, 200 rural communities in 33 local government areas of Anambra, Enugu, Niger, Kano, Jigawa, Kebbi and Sokoto states are benefiting from the project; with a total of 692 demonstration farms established across the zones on rice, sorghum and cassava. So far, 52,410 beneficiaries have been reached directly through the programme’s intervention while 152,651.7 metric tonnes of food have been produced and released into the domestic economy.”<br /><br />For many of the farmers, the project is not only building their capacity, but has also strengthened their agribusinesses through the outreach entrepreneurship and product development programme. They said if the impact the programme has made in the seven states is sustained with the states paying their counterpart fund properly, many more smallholder farmers, communities would benefit significantly.<br /><br />A young lady, Mrs. Lydia Onochie, who through the initiative now owns a 0.5 hectare of rice farm in Adani, Enugu State, said her perception of farming was changed by the training she and others received on seed multiplication:<br /><br />“Farming is no longer business as usual, it’s now a business; now I have a company that is going to buy my seeds, which means I’m going to get more money.” She hopes to expand her farm to three hectares in the next season.<br /><br /><b>By:&nbsp; Magnus Eze</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "FG to Provide Insurance Cover for 3.8 Million Farmers",
    "content": "<br />The Federal Government is planning to increase insurance coverage for the agricultural sector from the current 500,000 farmers to 3.8 million farmers.<br /><br />The Managing Director, Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending, Mr. Aliyu Abdulhameed, said at a forum in Abuja on Monday that the move would help increase the level of output for the sector.<br /><br />To achieve this, he said NIRSAL had commenced discussions with Royal Exchange Assurance and the Nigerian Meteorological Agency, among others, for the development of a technology-driven hybrid index insurance product.<br /><br />According to Abdulhameed, NIRSAL is also exploring innovative insurance products for livestock to help stem the tide of herdsmen and farmers’ clashes.<br /><br />He stated, “As indispensable as insurance is, it is the provider of mitigation of last resort. NIRSAL guarantees that smallholder farmers are supported in the areas of training and mentoring to ensure adherence to good agronomical practices. The support ranges from input, quality control to harvesting.<br /><br />“We have made significant investments in technology solutions and innovations to counter the risks occurring in agricultural projects that we support. For instance, we have piloted the use of Geographic Information Systems to carry out field verification so that only viable lands are utilised for agriculture.”<br /><br />The Commissioner for Insurance, Mohammed Kari, stated that the collaboration between NAICOM and NIRSAL had so far been very successful, adding that product approval had been granted to five companies to participate in the index-based agricultural insurance in Nigeria.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMQQBe8_Rp0/WdzPymfLTVI/AAAAAAAAAR8/3fsK9lJeErYALMrz830cWVrgCmPLxAIdACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/NIRSAL.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMQQBe8_Rp0/WdzPymfLTVI/AAAAAAAAAR8/3fsK9lJeErYALMrz830cWVrgCmPLxAIdACPcBGAYYCw/s320/NIRSAL.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />This number, he said, was expected to grow to 20 in the coming years.<br /><br />“Using weather insurance to manage the risk of catastrophic weather events will stimulate economic development by improving stability and opportunities for growth in the agricultural and financial sectors,” Kari noted.<br /><br />…to remove VAT from airlines’ charges<br /><br /><b>Maureen Ihua-Maduenyi</b><br /><br />Indications have emerged that the Federal Government is working on removing Value Added Tax from the charges and taxes being paid by domestic airlines in the country.<br /><br />Our correspondent gathered on Monday that a presidential committee set up late last year to review the airlines’ taxes and charges and headed by the Minister of State for Aviation, Senator Hadi Sirika, had picked the removal of VAT as one of the first issues to be dealt with.<br /><br />Airlines pay five per cent of the value of each ticket sold to the Federal Government as VAT through the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority and the Nigerian Airspace Management Agency.<br /><br />The Airline Operators of Nigeria had estimated that its members were paying over N10bn as taxes annually, and this it noted, was threatening their operations.<br /><br />Among the charges paid by domestic operators are landing and parking fees, fuel surcharge, passenger service charge, ticket sales charge, ground rent and VAT.<br /><br />Others are terminal charges, apron licence charge, vehicle permit charge, apron pass charge and toll gate charges, among several others.<br /><br />The Chairman, AON, Capt. Nogie Meggison, had stated that the taxes paid by airlines indicated that the government and its agencies did not want air transport to thrive in the country.<br /><br />“This explains why domestic carriers have very short life span of average of 10 years. The greatest competitor of airlines in Africa is not low cost carriers but the road transport. Yet, road, marine and rail transport modes do not pay VAT, while domestic air transport pays. Even foreign airlines don’t pay VAT both in Nigeria and in their home countries,” he stated.<br /><br />As a way of cushioning the effect of the taxes, the Federal Inland Revenue Service last year said it had opened a payment window to assist domestic carriers meet their VAT remittance obligations.<br /><br />The FIRS Chairman, Mr. Babatunde Fowler, had said during a meeting with a delegation of the AON and the International Air Transport Association in Abuja that the window would enable airlines to structure the payment of their VAT after two months of billing, adding that exemptions on tax issues were beyond the agency.<br /><br />The Director of Air Transport Regulations, NCAA, Group Capt. Edem Oyo-Ita (retd), told our correspondent that some of the charges on the airlines were fixed without due consultation with the agency, but that the government had commenced a process to review all levies paid by domestic operators.<br /><br />He said, “The transport sector is not supposed to pay VAT and aviation is part of the sector. The government is aware of the problems that domestic airline operators face and is looking at it holistically.<br /><br />“There are lots of efforts also to improve facilities at the airports, especially the international airports, such as improving navigational aids. Every tax should be paid after consultation with stakeholders and approved by the NCAA, but some were fixed without regards to the regulatory agency.<br /><br />“But now, there’s a presidential committee to review all charges, removal of VAT may be the immediate one and a quick fix in addressing double taxation for airlines.”<br /><br /><b>By: Ifeanyi Onuba,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Agriculture Feeding Africa’s Economic Transformation",
    "content": "<br />Rural areas are poised to be a significant economic driver in developing countries. According to the latest 2017 State of Food and Agriculture report by the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are transforming rural communities and promoting agriculture. “Since the 1990s, rural transformations in many countries have led to an increase of more than 750 million in the number of rural people living above the poverty line,” says FAO.<br /><br />“To achieve the same results in the countries that have been left behind, the report outlines a strategy that would leverage the enormous untapped potential of food systems to drive agro-industrial development, boost small-scale farmers’ productivity and incomes, and create off-farm employment in expanding segments of food supply and value chains.”<br /><br />While the prospects of lifting rural communities out of poverty look good, progress is slowed down by rapid population growth. According to the report, between 2015 and 2030, the combined population of Africa and Asia is expected to rise from 5.6 billion to more than 6.6 billion. It further states that in sub-Saharan Africa, the number of people aged 15 – 24 years is projected to increase by more than 90 million by 2030, with the highest rise in rural areas. The large increases in youth population will create a challenge of unemployment in the decades to come. There is low productivity in the industrial sector and agriculture, which means new job seekers will struggle to find employment. As a result, those who migrate from rural areas to the cities will likely add to the growing numbers of the urban poor.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kye0iRaQ8zI/WnhwOxzyG8I/AAAAAAAABD4/4KV_SMDrBK0hdmZLRNIawn6Yain4NWbUQCLcBGAs/s1600/Annie%2BSpratt.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"598\" data-original-width=\"897\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kye0iRaQ8zI/WnhwOxzyG8I/AAAAAAAABD4/4KV_SMDrBK0hdmZLRNIawn6Yain4NWbUQCLcBGAs/s320/Annie%2BSpratt.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />According to the report, rural communities are therefore likely to escape poverty if they remain in rural areas and not move to urban areas. The solution is to drive investment to rural areas and create policies that support small-scale farmers. Currently, smallholder food producers have little to no access to profitable markets and value chains, which are dominated by large producers and retailers.<br /><br />To ensure small-scale farmers meet the food demand both in urban and rural areas, policies need to be introduced that “reduce the barriers limiting their access to inputs; foster the adoption of environmentally sustainable approaches and technologies; increase access to credit and markets; facilitate farm mechanisation; revitalize agricultural extension systems; strengthen land tenure rights; ensure equity in supply contracts; and strengthen small-scale producer organisations.”<br /><br />While industrial development in sub-Saharan Africa has been slower than other regions, rural transformations can be done by leveraging food systems to meet the growing demand for food in urban areas. The aim is to diversify food systems and create new economic opportunities in off-farm, agriculture-related activities such as trading, processing, packaging, distribution, and storage. The increasing demand coming from urban food markets is expected to be a major driver behind rural transformations.<br /><br />However, while the growing urban food demand creates a “golden opportunity” for agriculture, it may also present challenges for smallholder farmers. The extension of small pieces of farmland into larger commercial farms may lead to the exclusion of millions of smallholder farmers from taking advantage of emerging opportunities. To ensure this transformation benefits everyone, especially the most vulnerable, policy makers and governments need to understand the socio-economic links between cities, towns and rural areas and how they influence the food system.<br /><br />“Small farmers may need support if they are to benefit fully from emerging opportunities. Their lack of access to finance, markets and transport, as well as the barriers created by standards on quality, traceability and certification, often make their participation in integrated value chains very difficult. In many countries, the ongoing fragmentation of farmland may further hinder smallholder farmers’ capacity to adopt new technologies.” – FAO.<br /><br />As urbanisation continues to sweep across the continent, rural areas and small cities hold the key to economic growth. This is the main takeaway to policymakers, who possess the power to bring the change those living in rural areas need.<br /><br /><b>By Standard Bank</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why We Must Revive Cotton Farming in Nigeria – DG, RMRDC",
    "content": "<b>What are the major mandates of your Council?&nbsp;</b><br />The major mandates of the Council are to promote the development and optimal utilisation of locally available raw materials by the manufacturing sector of the economy.&nbsp; The Council is also to ensure the development of process equipment or adaptation of existing ones for use by the sector.<br /><br />You seem to have an uncommon passion for the cotton, textiles and garments sector of the economy.<br /><br />&nbsp;I studied Textiles Engineering up to PhD level. When I was growing up, the sector was one of the major industrial sectors the country had serious pride in. Its influence pervaded the whole of Africa and beyond, both in terms of employment generation and contribution to national GDP.<br /><br />I am always baffled by the travails of this sector and I believe that through multidisciplinary approach, the problems can be resolved.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result, I am always deeply concerned and ready to correct any problem of the sector that is within the mandates of the Council.<br /><br />Our textile industry used to be robust one in the olden days, where many households usually depended on for their livelihood…<br /><br />(Cut in) It is on record that the northern Nigeria textile industry experienced an unprecedented growth in the history of Africa. By 1911, Kano was producing more than two million rolls of cloth per year.&nbsp; The textile manufacturers were distributed all over the territory and export of local textiles to West African countries became intensified. During the 19th Century, the Kano textile industry reached extraordinary production levels. Kano’s popularity as a market was due to a series of commercial incentives and greater regulation of market transaction. Likewise in southern Nigeria, the British Cotton Growers Association was operating three large ginneries at Ibadan, Lafenwa near Abeokuta&nbsp; and Lokoja.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_-80bmt8f3A/WhbeIncQcOI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/wi8DgyUD_8gqTOZdwwdOTTaHzkxDJJeMQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cotton%2BPlantation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_-80bmt8f3A/WhbeIncQcOI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/wi8DgyUD_8gqTOZdwwdOTTaHzkxDJJeMQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Cotton%2BPlantation.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>The Nigerian textile industry spread considerably, and by 1987, the industry had grown to be the third largest in Africa, attracting investment from China and India, with over 170 urban textile mills and about 600,000 skilled and unskilled labour earning their living through it.&nbsp; The sector, in the 1980s, made annual turnover of $8.95 billion and generated 25per cent of the manufacturing Gross Domestic Product. It accounted for not less than 10per cent of the corporate income taxes.&nbsp;<br /><br />With about 1.3 million cotton farmers in the country’s cotton production belt and a dependency ratio of one farmer to eight dependants, an estimated 17.2 million people derived their livelihood from the sector.&nbsp;<br /><br />What went wrong; and how is the government trying to put things in order for the sector?<br /><br />From the 1990s, the fortune of the textile industry dipped and the number of textile mills dropped considerably.&nbsp; The industry that was producing at over 63per cent capacity utilisation dropped to a very low capacity utilisation ebb.&nbsp; The textile mills in operation dropped to 25 with about 24,000 workers and projected dependant level of less than 250,000 people.&nbsp;<br /><br />But in direct response to your question, the Federal Government, in realisation of the sector’s importance in job creation, proposed a N70billion lifeline that was eventually raised to N100 billion for the sector.&nbsp; The textile industrial revival scheme was also based on the belief that the cotton, textile and garment industry stands out as a potential growth area of the economy that could propel the country towards achieving vision 20:2020 and the Millennium Development Goals.<br /><br />Despite the efforts of the government, although many ginneries and textile mills were reactivated, cotton farmers did not benefit to any significant extent. Today, many of the ginneries that benefitted are handicapped in repaying the facilities, principally because of low cotton production levels and other challenges.&nbsp; As a result, there has not been any significant improvement as analysts put the growth rate in the sector at less than 1per cent in the last two years, with little or no significant impact on the nation’s GDP or noticeable boost in the sector’s employment ratio.&nbsp;<br /><br />Presently in Nigeria, cotton lint is the most important single apparel fibre. Although other raw materials, such as kenaf, bamboo, dissolving pulp from hardwoods exist, cotton is the basic raw material in the Nigerian textile industry. Thus, the domestic availability of cotton is the essential factor for the establishment of the industry in the country.<br /><br />But despite the importance of cotton to textile industry revival, its production locally has not been quite impressive.<br /><br />&nbsp;The peak period of cotton production in Nigeria was as far back as 1976/77 when about 453,126 bales (183.43kg/bale) were produced.&nbsp; Thereafter, production started to decline due to price flunctuation, pest infestation and other related problems.&nbsp; By 1983/84, only 69,000 bales was produced, while the demand was about 531,000 bales, which might have been satisfied through importation.&nbsp; <br /><br />Production in Nigeria is mainly from three cotton zones, namely, the northern zone (60%), eastern zone (30%) and southwest zone (10%) respectively. Production is dominated by small scale farmers; with farm sizes ranging from 3-5 ha all under rain fed ecologies. Seed cotton yield range from 0.6 - 1.5 tons per ha, and about 98per cent of the cotton grown locally belongs to Gossypium hirsutum species with G barbadense, making the balance of 2per cent.&nbsp; Other causes of poor crop yield in Nigeria have been attributed to late planting, adverse weather condition, finance and high cost of production.<br /><br />As a raw material research organisation, what are you doing to improve the growth of cotton in the country?<br /><br />While cotton production is practised as small scale activities in Nigeria, cotton production in most parts of the world is regarded as a high yielding and investment activity.<br /><br />While some of the problems of cotton development in Nigeria require radical approach through direct intervention by the government, a number of them are being solved through multi-institutional and multidisciplinary approach.&nbsp; For instance, the Council had been collaborating with relevant research institutes to provide the necessary impetus for the rejuvenation and reinvigoration of the sector. One approach the Council adopted was to co-fund the development and official release of three three improved long staple cotton varieties in collaboration with the Institute of Agricultural Research (IAR/ABU), Zaria.&nbsp;<br /><br />The primary objective of the collaboration was to develop improved varieties of cotton that would be acceptable to the farmers. This effort has led to the release of Samcot 11, 12 and 13 varieties that produce better quality textile products.<br /><br />The Council has been supplying farmers with these varieties so as to increase production and expand the hectarage under cultivation.&nbsp; In 2015, the Council presented 5.82 tonnes of improved cotton seeds (SAMCOT 8’ 9’ 10’ 11’ 12 &amp; 13’) to all cotton farmers under the umbrella of the National Cotton Association of Nigeria (NACOTAN). Similarly, about 4.3 tonnes of the same varieties of cotton were also distributed to the cotton farmers in June 2016. Also, in June 2017,&nbsp; about 4.0 tonnes of the same cotton seeds were distributed to the cotton farmers for 2017 planting season across the country<br /><br />To ensure adherence to best practice principles, the Council embarked on capacity building training for cotton farmers on the best agronomics practices for cotton production in the various cotton growing zones in Nigeria.&nbsp;<br /><br />In 2015, about 292 cotton farmers and ADP staff were trained across the four geo-political zones where cotton is grown. Also, in September 2017, over 400 cotton farmers were trained by experts from the Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), Zaria. The Council equally provided training manual for all the farmers that attended the training programmes.&nbsp;<br /><br />An assessment of the production capacity of the cotton farmers in the four cotton growing zones carried out in 2016 showed that yield increased in 2016 as a result of the impacted knowledge. The spraying and picking of the seed cotton by farmers are now done by adopting best practices without allowing stain and trashes, resulting in very white lint.<br /><br />In November 2016, the Council, in collaboration with Crown Natures, organised entrepreneurship training on industrial garment production for local and international markets. Over 200 participants were trained in garment production.&nbsp;<br /><br />To further the development of this sector, the Council, in collaboration with the National Research Institute for Chemical Technology (NARICT), developed an automated rapier weaving machine for the commercial production of aso-oke fabrics. The machine is made up of 112 units, comprising of about 397 components, most of which are made of mild steel and cast iron.&nbsp; &nbsp;The weaving machine, when fully commercialised, will remove drudgery associated with local weaving methods, increase productivity and profitability of weavers.&nbsp; The weaving loom is faster, more efficient and appropriate for large scale economic production.<br /><br />The Council,&nbsp; in 2017, also looked at the possibility of using bamboo and kenaf for production of textile fibres.&nbsp; It is our belief that one of the ways capacity utilisation can be boosted is to introduce bamboo as an alternative or complimentary raw material for textiles production locally as bamboo fibre consists of 99.51per cent cellulose, 0.25per cent ash and 0.24per cent wax.&nbsp;<br /><br />Likewise, in order to have a holistic data on all the possible raw materials for textiles production in the country, the Council constituted a committee of experts to study the production of dissolving pulp from indigenous hardwoods. Dissolving pulp has a high cellulose content (90%).<br /><br /><b>By Hussein Yahaya&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Fortis Mobile Money, Funding Agriculture Through DIFRAD —MD",
    "content": "<br />The Managing Director of Fortis Mobile Money Limited, Mr. Samuel Oladimeji, said the company has designed a unique method of funding agriculture.<br /><br />According to him, DiFRAD is an acronym that means Digital Finance for Rural Agricultural Development. It is a product developed for smallholder farmers especially ones in the rural and peri-urban communities in the North Central, North East and The North West.<br /><br />His words: “This is digital agricultural initiative. The product was inspired by a first-hand encounter with some farming communities in Niger state and Cross River during some of our Cash Transfer Programs. We discovered that most of our beneficiaries are actually farmers who are constrained by lack of financial services and sometimes know-how. We immediately started toying with the idea of filling their gap by bringing the banks to them&nbsp; and linking them with agricultural developers.<br /><br />“To achieve this, we had to partner with micro finance banks, agricultural developers&nbsp; and insurance companies as we worked on a suite of products that will cater for the extensive needs of the farmers.”<br /><br />He regretted that it has been really difficult for the Mobile Money Operators (MMOs) to craft a value proposition that will address the real needs of their target market even though that target markets might differ across MMOs.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x9FX-IE1edk/WnhicDC9k6I/AAAAAAAABDg/-PI1Leyn62shd73NqykJB2mckpLh0Q0MACLcBGAs/s1600/Samuel-Oladimeji%2BMD.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-x9FX-IE1edk/WnhicDC9k6I/AAAAAAAABDg/-PI1Leyn62shd73NqykJB2mckpLh0Q0MACLcBGAs/s320/Samuel-Oladimeji%2BMD.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said: “We at Fortis Mobile Money have always believed in going the whole nine yards. We believe it should be done the right way. We have refused to take the short cut to immediate but fleeting profit. Of course we know that we can choose to drive value through bill payments and wallet-to-bank transfers but then any sort of aggressive marketing of e-channels by the commercial banks would leave MMOs scrambling for market share in an already saturated market.<br /><br />Speaking further, he added that “what we have done is tailored to the needs of the BOP customers. These products include Mobile Microfinance, Cash Transfer Package and recently DiFRAD”.<br /><br />Oladimeji believes the product is unique because it focuses on the value chain instead of isolated financing. Hear him: “We in partnership with the microfinance banks and insurance companies finance the entire value chain starting from provision of farm land through its clearing to its harvesting, processing and selling. It is our passion to end the marginalization of small holder farmers by buyers and even nature by providing knowledge and guidance as they journey through the digital finance value chain. Our package even extends to the provision of inputs and we have consulted critical expertise to look at the proposition and ensure that we achieve the desired impact. This is why the whole process is mostly digital and going digital guarantees a level of transparency.<br /><br />“At Fortis Money, we see ourselves as a socially responsible organization and DiFRAD to us is part of the ways we give back to the community. The overarching goal is to reduce the poverty level in rural communities seeing that their most recurrent occupation is farming. EFINA 2016 reports opined that financial exclusion level has grown in the rural areas. We see these rural areas as predominantly farmers. Small holder farmers are actually the providers of about 85% of the locally produced food in the circulation in the markets,” he stated.<br /><br />The CEO has a word for President Buhari administration. He said “we have witnessed demonstrated resolve of the government to properly incentivize agriculture. While the government faces challenges especially with regards to reaching the (BOP), small holder farmers, I believe that the solution is Public Private Partnership. The privately owned organizations with the right organization and the right process have the opportunity to bridge the gap between the government and the rural farmers. At Fortis Money, we are fully investing in that proposition. We are focused on providing a platform that will enable the government, NGOs and the financial institutions reach the small holder farmer,” he added.<br /><br />By Chima Nwokoji<br />Tribune News<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigerian Farmers can Make Fortune Growing Semi-arid Apple",
    "content": "<br />For weather related reasons, Nigeria does not produce apples even though there has been a steady increase in its demand by middle class and large retail outlets.<br /><br />Many still believe that apple cannot grow in Nigerian. But every year, Nigerians spend millions of dollars importing the fruit from South Africa and other European countries. The reason Nigeria spends so much to import apple is not far fetched. People often eat apple raw but it can also be found in many prepared foods and drinks. And there are many health benefits thought to result from eating apples.<br /><br />Statistics indicate that Nigeria imported 1,882 tonnes, 7,857 tonnes and 32,317 tonnes of apples between 2011, 2012 and 2013 respectively from South Africa. Industry watchers said these figures have increased tremendously in the last four years as millions of dollars is expended on importation of apples.<br /><br />However, apart from statistics available in 2011, 2012, 2013, there is no recent data to indicate amount of apples imported and consumed in Nigeria, but large numbers of apples are imported and brought in through the nation’s borders. But the demand for the product continues to increase indicating that there is a sustainable market for apples in Nigeria, which is largely being driven by the increasing preference for fresh fruit over processed fruit.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HN40semsUv4/WeCfDZgvUXI/AAAAAAAAAWc/yyiKhgVl-GgrnWa8gkIPIbRZn8QaoIu9ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B21.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"148\" data-original-width=\"340\" height=\"139\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HN40semsUv4/WeCfDZgvUXI/AAAAAAAAAWc/yyiKhgVl-GgrnWa8gkIPIbRZn8QaoIu9ACPcBGAYYCw/s320/picture%2B21.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br />It is clearly stated that apples that are sold at shops, in hotels and Nigerian markets have been harvested before they get ripe and they take weeks and months before getting here. Even the apples are injected somehow to preserve them.<br /><br />There is good news for farmers who want to venture into this money spinning fruit. Today, there is a specie of apple called semi-arid apple, also known as ‘wambugu’ apple, which matches Nigeria’s weather conditions. This basically means that the apple can grow and do well in Nigeria, as government is looking for a way of reducing import bills.<br /><br />The semi-arid apple was developed by Peter Wambugu, a man who used to work as a mechanic in the streets of Nyeri, central Kenya, now a trained agriculture expert.<br /><br />The semi-arid apple can grow to climate of up to 36°, which is within Nigeria’s weather conditions because the apple specifically is for hot and warm areas and it has a lifespan of 50 years. The apple can grow in any West African country and anywhere in the world. The semi-arid apple bears up 500 to 2000 fruits on each tree every season and it has two seasons in a year, starting between July, August, December and January.<br /><br />As Nigerians look for fresh fruits and food everyday, it would be advisable for farmers to invest as early as possible and take advantage of the prevailing opportunities to make some good returns.<br /><br />Presently, in Nigerian markets, a piece of apple goes for N50, N100 and above depending on its size. Some hotels buy apple in cartons week in, week out, which shows the huge prospects for the fruits. If a tree produces at least 500 fruits per harvest and multiply the 500 by N50 and also with 250 to 300 trees, you know how much that will fetch you in two seasons.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, on the potential of the fruit, the Chief Executive Officer, Wambugu Apple Farm, Peter Wambugu, said the semi-arid apple variety is a kind of apple that does best in hot and warm areas, which makes it different from any other imported apple, saying it requires only manure and water for it to grow well.<br /><br />According to him, the semi-arid apple variety has a very good income as the harvest season comes every nine to 13 months.<br /><br />He explained: “I began this farming 40 years ago. Till now, even my children are still farming apples. This apple won the best apple in the world that is able to grow anywhere in any climate and soil. The apples are organically grown and thus, they need good manure and water for them to grow better. They can grow to climate of up to 36°! The apple takes nine to 14 months to mature to fruiting and one acre requires 310 plants.”<br /><br />On planting, he said: “When you get your seedling, allow 5m by 5m spacing from one plant to another. 2fts by 2fts deep 2fts! Mix 1 bucket of manure with topsoil and return back to the hole later; putting 20 liters of water mix with the soil well and plant the seedling! Later do mulching! For pest control, since this apple has very few pests, it would be able to grow with very minimal maintenance. Climate and soil type are no problem for the semi-arid apple variety.<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

They say it is time-consuming and that they do not have the time for it.<br /><br />So they ignore the activity of records keeping. However, record keeping is a very important task in farming. If you plan to be a prominent farmer with productive farms, you cannot avoid record keeping in your daily farming endeavours. Knowledge acquired from keeping good farm records in priceless.<br /><br />Present-day farm operations are becoming more and more business oriented than yesterday farm operations. Being a good producer is no longer good enough to remain in business. The key to becoming a successful farmer today is being a good producer as well as a good financial manager.<br /><br />The first step in being a successful farm owner/manager is keeping good, accurate records and establishing a sound record-keeping system. There is a misconception that the only reason a person needs records is to loan or report taxes. However, record keeping plays a much larger role in business. Farming is a business and records can be helpful in planning improvements for that business and making proper management decisions.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-u5XX5NsvTxQ/WijzzIf29BI/AAAAAAAAA78/hpj6_w0zMSctC0y5pMvJzdDWjG6AtzWxQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Agri-Business.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"522\" data-original-width=\"696\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-u5XX5NsvTxQ/WijzzIf29BI/AAAAAAAAA78/hpj6_w0zMSctC0y5pMvJzdDWjG6AtzWxQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Agri-Business.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br />As a farm owner/manager, you need a complete and accurate farm records’ system to make informed management decisions that will help maintain or improve your business profitability. Records can help you plan and implement farm business arrangements and do estate and other transfer farming. You can use records to determine what the efficiencies and the inefficiencies are, measure progress of the business and plan for the future.<br /><br />There are many farm record systems. They range from simple, hand accounting systems using pencil and paper to sophisticated double-entry computer-accounting systems, which require computer operations. Some require a mix of hand and computer operations. Choose a system that is easy to understand and designed specially for your convenience.<br /><br />It should not only meet the accounting and planting needs of the farm operation, but it should also satisfy income tax, legal and other outside reporting requirements. The first step is to determine your objectives for the system – both personal and business.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), “Conservation agriculture is an approach to managing agro-ecosystems for improved and sustained productivity, increased profits and food security while preserving and enhancing the resource base and the environment”.<br /><br />The principles of conservation agriculture principles could be applied to all agricultural lands and practiced in all agro-ecological zones.<br /><br />It entails optimum usage of agrochemicals, organic and inorganic fertilisers in ways and quantities that do not interfere with, or disrupt biological processes, in addition minimising or totally eliminating mechanical disturbance to the soil.<br /><br />Conservation agriculture (CA) facilitates good agronomy, such as timely operations, and improves overall agricultural land using both irrigation and rain-fed production.<br /><br />It counters the concept of soil tillage/ ploughing prior to planting, additionally marking it as being responsible for destruction of soil organic matter, a crucial element for the stabilisation of soil structure.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7a0YhXZwN8U/WnLv2Prkz1I/AAAAAAAABDM/ywt41XQfSyUnTKecnxRLDKGOz0dNbBWzwCLcBGAs/s1600/Food%2Band%2BAgricultural%2BOrganisation%2BFAO.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-7a0YhXZwN8U/WnLv2Prkz1I/AAAAAAAABDM/ywt41XQfSyUnTKecnxRLDKGOz0dNbBWzwCLcBGAs/s320/Food%2Band%2BAgricultural%2BOrganisation%2BFAO.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />It is worthy to note that a soil left without tilling for long allows crops residues/mulch to remain on the soil surface, as such protecting the soil from rainfall, heat from the sun and wind. It also stabilises temperature and moisture which becomes conducive for beneficial small and large organisms that help in decomposition of the mulch for stabilising the soil structure.<br /><br />For this method to be effective, integrated pest management becomes necessary.<br /><br />One of the ways to achieve this is through crop rotation, which involves interrupting the chain of disease if any. Also, chemical pesticides and herbicides may be used but with caution to minimise their effects on soil life.<br /><br />Soils under conservation agriculture have significantly higher water infiltration capacities, with high reduction in surface runoff that causes soil erosion.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Ranches, Colonies Feasible Only After FG Remedies 6 Issues — Report",
    "content": "<br />The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, last week in Abuja officially received the report of the national conference that looked at a 10-year (2018 -2027) transformation roadmap for the Nigerian livestock industry.<br /><br />The National Conference on the report was Transformation of the Nigerian Livestock Industry submitted by the Local Organising Committee chaired by Dr. Gideon M. Mshelbwala, Director, Department of Veterinary and Pest Control Services and Mr. John T. Taiwo, Director, Department of Animal Husbandry.<br /><br />The report seen by Daily Trust is in two parts; with part one looking at a 10-year National Livestock Development Plan (2018-2027) with strategies towards actualizing the conference recommendations while part two examined the details and record of its proceedings.<br /><br />The document, which summaries key recommendations of the policy dialogue that was held in Kaduna in April 2017, and the National Conference on the Transformation of the Nigerian Livestock Industry held in Abuja, 11-15 September 2017, stressed that cattle ranching and by extension the new colonies would not be realistic until the Federal Government deals with six key issues.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gCUimF_E9vA/WdcyY9u-ETI/AAAAAAAAAQY/iylnmJmRwY0Jay3-vgnCuMJZZqCuj8PzQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"231\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"184\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-gCUimF_E9vA/WdcyY9u-ETI/AAAAAAAAAQY/iylnmJmRwY0Jay3-vgnCuMJZZqCuj8PzQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“From the experiences shared at the conference and the pre-conference dialogue, ranching cannot be embarked upon until these six major and critical factors are given top priority as they are the pillars that hold the value chain, especially at the production end,” it said.<br /><br />The report listed the factors as follows:<br /><br />One: That access to land is key to successful ranching and other forms of intensive livestock production systems. “It is, therefore, paramount to give it the priority it deserves in the design of, and location of the proposed ranches. Consequently, it is envisaged that the plan will take-off in the 16 pioneer ranch states that have pledged 5,000ha each towards the transformation of the livestock industry as well as 141 gazzetted grazing reserves nationwide.”<br /><br />Two: On ranch, colony size and models, the Federal Government was advised in the report to encourage “the formation and registration of livestock owners into productive alliance, cooperatives or clusters along family or clan lines to facilitate access to land and support for ranching, taking into cognizance herd size holdings and ranching locations.”<br /><br />Three: Grazing land and feed production, which are the most important elements in ranching and colonies, must be accorded top priority as “commercial pasture and fodder producers need to be promoted and supported as part of the ranching programme. This is to ensure availability of feed and water to curtail pastoralism and transhumance.”<br /><br />Four: There is need to develop breeds that can attain economical productivity to ensure profits in production. Therefore, a Breed Improvement Programme should be embarked upon through selection and cross breeding.&nbsp; There is the need to also finalize and adopt the National Livestock Breeding Policy that would also ensure conservation of 20% of indigenous cattle population of pure breed for both beef and dairy.<br /><br />Five: With regard to credit facilities, “Government should therefore re-structure the sub-sector and provide the required policy support, alternative funding windows at single digit interest rate and an enabling business environment such as making productive assets as debenture collateral.”<br /><br />And six: The development and provision of infrastructure and deployment of services such as extension, improved breeding schemes, skills, disease control and management, capacity building as well as livestock institutions reforms among others will be necessary for the programme.<br /><br />The document also asked government to provide Rancher Starter Package. Set of vital inputs and tools to enable ranch take off.<br /><br />The report asked the minister, Chief Ogbeh, to seek the support and commitment of his colleagues at the federal level as well as political and resource commitment at state and local government levels and that of all the stakeholders.<br /><br />It emphasised that “Since the plan’s commencement cannot be captured under the FMARD’s 2018 budget, its take-off funding is proposed to be accommodated under the Federal Government’s Special Intervention Fund (Extra budgetary allocation) and private equity.<br /><br />“However, it is recommended that a National Livestock Industry Transformation Fund be created and funded with percentage of duties/levies/taxes derived from livestock and livestock products imports.”<br /><br />Chief Ogbeh, while receiving the report, stated: “We have listened to what people have said and we recognise people’s rights to freedom of expression, but let me reiterate once again that the government is not seizing land of any Nigerian to give to Fulani herdsmen for them to colonise.”<br /><br />The programme is also not an appeasement of Fulanis at the detriment of crop farmers either, he said and also refuted the allegation of sell out, cautioning that “if today, we as government and citizens don’t find a practical solution to the problem as quickly as possible, it will get worse tomorrow.”<br /><br />“We didn’t envisage how much high voltage emotion and politicking this issue has generated. It is one of our characteristics as a country that we live with. We need to educate the herdsmen, educate every one of us of the need to move away from what we were doing before that is bringing conflict for many reasons; avoiding crisis and making this industry more productive,” Ogbeh said.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Farmers Hopeful of in Fertiliser Prices",
    "content": "<br />Dangote Group is set to commence production at its $2 billion fertilizer plant located in Lekki industrial area of Lagos, in June this year.<br /><br />Alhaji Aliko Dangote, president of the group, made the revelation in an interview at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland.<br /><br />The three million tons per annum production capacity is expected to drag down the huge cost of fertilizer not only in the country but across the entire West African markets.<br /><br />“We are confident that the production will commence in June at the fertilizer plant and we cannot wait to get the plant working,” he stated.<br /><br />The plant, which has the capacity of producing 8,000 tonnes of urea daily (one of the largest single fertiliser complex in the world), will add to the other two giant fertilizer companies (Notore and Indorama) already in production in Nigeria.<br /><br />Indorama Fertiliser and Chemical Limited produces 1.5 million MT of urea fertilizer per annum, at a capacity of 4,000MT per day, according to its Head of Agronomy, Dr Balbir Singh. Notore has a production capacity of 0.5 million metric tonnes of urea fertilizer.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yNNT-syrvvc/WnLttTDedXI/AAAAAAAABDA/EFLI4v_PAKIKt8_el26Xntkk1NgPUFkygCLcBGAs/s1600/Fertilizer.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"463\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yNNT-syrvvc/WnLttTDedXI/AAAAAAAABDA/EFLI4v_PAKIKt8_el26Xntkk1NgPUFkygCLcBGAs/s320/Fertilizer.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Despite this, farmers’ access to fertiliser has remained a huge challenge on a yearly basis in the country.<br /><br />Late arrival of fertiliser in the market, high cost of the commodity and availability of NPK and other brands are huge challenge for farmers in the country.&nbsp; In addition the two big fertiliser companies pay more attention to urea production.<br /><br />The general belief among farmers in the country is that the arrival of Dangote’s plant will help address most of these problems.<br /><br />Head of Marketing at Indorama, Mr Surendra Srivastava, disclosed that the company, which commenced production in June 2016, has supplied over 250, 000MT by the end of January 2017 to farmers in the 36 states of the federation.<br /><br />“Our total production exceeds the country’s demand for urea fertiliser, so first we satisfy local demand. Nigeria consumes 30% of our production, 70% is exported to other countries like South Africa, Brazil and Argentina,” Mr. Srivastava said.<br /><br />&nbsp;At Notore, Dr Innocent Okuku, Head, Marketing Services, told Daily Trust that the company has a production capacity of 0.5 million metric tonnes of urea fertilizer.<br /><br />Although Notore also has the capacity to produce 500,000 metric tonnes of NPK, it produces that only when there is demand locally for it, Okuku stated.<br /><br />These three fertilizer plants will bring Nigeria’s production capacity for Urea fertilizer to five million metric tonnes per annum, which the Nigerian market cannot absorb.<br /><br />However, these companies do not pay much attention to the production of NPK fertiliser, which is also in high demand by local consumers.<br /><br />Nigeria had two big fertiliser production plants: Federal Superphosphate Fertilizer Company (FSFC) set up in 1976 and the National Fertilizer Company of Nigeria (NAFCON) set up in 1988 to produce 1 million tonnes of urea per year. The two companies have since collapsed due to poor management.<br /><br />However, the Federal Government sold them to private entrepreneurs after several attempts to revive them failed.<br /><br />In 2017, however, government entere into an arrangement with its Moroccan counterpart for the supply of phosphate for the production of 1million tonnes of NPK.<br /><br />That arrangement is now leading to resuscitate of some 30 fertilizer and blending companies that were established but went moribund across the states.<br /><br />There are several other private companies blending different kinds of NPK’s (e.g. Golden Fertilizers and TAK Agro, Springfield Agro Ltd, etc.)<br /><br />Apart from urea and phosphate compound fertilizer, there is NPK compound fertilizer and other fertilizer blends such as the triple 15-15-15, 20-10-10, 10-20-10, designed for different crop needs.<br /><br />A look at the Nigerian fertilizer consumption trend over decades shows that the demand for NPK, urea and other fertilizers is on the increase.<br /><br />The Fertilizer Suppliers Association of Nigeria (FEPSAN), in collaboration with the Federal Fertilizer Department (FFD), Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, in a study of fertilizer consumption by crops, gave figures that showed that “potential national consumption of nitrogen for various crops in Nigeria is as follows: 2,198,968MT of nitrogen; 1,415,740MT of phosphorus; and 1,276,880MT of potassium with the potential for NPK at 4,891,580.”<br /><br />&nbsp;Similarly, AfricaFertiliser and USAID fertilizer statistics overview for Nigeria (2013-2016) released in 2017 showed that NPK was the most imported fertilizer into the country, accounting for 64% of total imports.<br /><br />It showed that fertilizer import for 2016 (593,994MT) was a 42.11% increase from 2015 (417,976MT).<br /><br />On fertilizer usage, “Nigeria consumes an average of 12 – 15kg of nutrient per hectare which is far below the 100kg nutrient per hectare world average. The per unit fertilizer rates are far below what should be obtained in developed agricultural systems,” the FEPSAN/FFD study said.<br /><b><br /></b><b>By Vincent A.

FAO’s 2017 State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World report found that despite a prolonged decline, world hunger is on the rise again. The increase is linked to conflicts and drought that affected many countries and hit rural areas particularly hard.<br /><br />The high-level meeting is the follow-up to a conference held in July 2013 in Addis Ababa during which the African Union, FAO and the Lula Institute launched an initiative aimed at eradicating hunger in Africa by 2025. A year later, the results of that meeting were consolidated through the Malabo Declaration, backed by African leaders.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AcReBgT7k3w/WnAyg2R5wZI/AAAAAAAABCk/piXbprkIb5gZaYvzZjXMznAsMCZRwwIdwCLcBGAs/s1600/africa-map.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-AcReBgT7k3w/WnAyg2R5wZI/AAAAAAAABCk/piXbprkIb5gZaYvzZjXMznAsMCZRwwIdwCLcBGAs/s320/africa-map.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Participants at the high-level event will include the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, the Prime Minister of Ethiopia Hailermariam Desalegn, and leaders from the African Development Bank (AfDB), the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the New Partnership for Africa’s Development&nbsp; (NEPAD), UNECA, and others.<br /><br />Former President of Nigeria Olusegun Obasanjo and former President of Brazil and World Food Prize winner Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva (via video) will also attend. Former President Obasanjo is a champion of empowering rural women in agriculture, which is a vital step towards eradicating hunger. Brazil sets an inspiring example after more than 30 million Brazilians were lifted out of extreme poverty in a 10-year period under their “Zero Hunger” programme, and is active in sharing its successes through south-south cooperation.<br /><br />Also on the sidelines of the AU Summit, the Director-General of FAO José Graziano da Silva will sign an agreement with the Government of Senegal for the opening of a new FAO Sub-regional Office for West Africa in Dakar. The President of Senegal, Macky Sall, as well as other West African Heads of State will attend the signing ceremony on Sunday 28 January. The office will foster FAO’s presence at the sub-regional level, and aims to further strengthen the long-standing collaboration between FAO and West African countries on food security, nutrition, agriculture and rural development.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins nnabuife</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "No, no to Cattle Colonies",
    "content": "<br />Let me declare at the outset that the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, is my friend. I also want to acknowledge the outstanding job he has been doing in the agricultural sector. But I disagree with his handling of the conflict between herdsmen and farmers. As a friend, I easily could have called him up on the phone to state my disagreement. However, the matter on which I disagree with him is a serious national issue, which is part of ongoing public discourse. I have contributed to the public discourse and this should be regarded as a continuation of that contribution.<br /><br />I agree with the minister that livestock farmers and their cow herders need some assistance; but not for the reasons he gave and not in the manner he is now suggesting. The reason he gave amounts to nothing but buck passing, while the measure he suggested that the government should adopt is historically naive and politically incorrect.<br /><br />The minister had argued that the ongoing rampage of farmlands and the killing of innocent farmers and their family members by Fulani herdsmen are due to the government’s failure to do for livestock farmers what the government had done for produce farmers: “Over the years, we have not done much to look seriously into the issue of livestock development in the country…we may have done enough for the rice farmer, the cassava farmer, the maize farmer, the cocoa farmer, but we haven’t done enough for herdsmen, and that inability and omission on our part is (sic) resulting in the crisis we are witnessing today.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />I understand the background to the minister’s statement. However, I wish he had not put it this way, because it not only wrongly passes the buck for the herdsmen’s misbehaviour to the government; it also sidetracks the reasons given by the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria and the affected herdsmen for their attacks on innocent farmers. Didn’t they argue that they killed in place of stolen cows? Isn’t there also the insinuation that part of Benue land belongs to the Fulani and, therefore, must be retrieved by force?<br /><br />This land-grabbing project cannot be dismissed outright, when one considers the evidence at hand: According to Vanguard Newspaper, at least 17 of Benue’s 23 Local Government Areas have been plundered by the herdsmen “with over 4,000 lives lost and property estimated at N95bn lost” (Vanguard, January 14, 2018).<br /><br />There is yet another reason Ogbeh’s statement was wrongheaded. It focused on appeasing the wrongdoers at the expense of the victims. Two immediate measures should have preceded any attempt to assist cow owners and their herders. First, the killer herdsmen should have been arrested and indicted for murder. Second, the victims should have been compensated. True, no compensation could adequately replace lost human lives; but at least, it will assuage the pain of their survivors. It is for this reason that the absence of a Federal Government representative at the mass burial of 73 victims on January 11, 2018, was a sad miscalculation.<br /><br />While I agree with the minister that livestock farmers need some assistance, the proposed establishment of cattle colonies is yet another misadventure in the Federal Government’s attempt to assist cow owners and herders.<br /><br />The proposal is wrong on many fronts. First, in terms of language and policy, the term, “cattle colonies”, is not politically correct. Political correctness is not just a matter of language choice. It also dictates that policies and measures would not be taken that could be construed as giving offence or disadvantage to members of particular groups in society. It is in this sense that cattle colonies are even more repugnant than the earlier proposal of grazing land, and it will be rejected as vehemently as that proposal.<br /><br />The idea of colonising other people’s land so that others will be able to raise their cattle on it seems to be oblivious to the history and consequences of the colonisation of Nigeria and the forced amalgamation of erstwhile independent nationalities, which underlies the ongoing clamour for restructuring the country.<br /><br />It is insensitive of the Federal Government to make such a proposal at this time, given its unsatisfactory response to the demand for restructuring. To expect the states in the South and the Middle Belt, which are in the forefront of the call for restructuring, to assent to ceding their land to cattle is preposterous.<br /><br />Besides, in this penultimate election year, when meaning is read into every measure or action taken by the government, the idea of cattle colonies rings a discordant note in the ears of those who heard about the Fulani expansionist project in Benue. Who knows what will happen to the colonies 50 years from now? Won’t the Fulani claim the land and even the state in which the colonies are located?<br /><br />If this proposal had been discussed with the state governors, in whom land is constitutionally vested, according to the Land Use Act 1979, before going public with it, the Federal Government would have been properly advised to drop the idea. The ongoing public rejection of the proposal by many governors would have been avoided.<br /><br />What is more, the Miyetti Allah in the North-East has now made a fool of the Federal Government over cattle colonies by turning around to accept ranching, provided the government can provide some kind of subsidy. On this column last week, I supported the idea of government subsidy, but not the way the Minister of Agriculture seems to be going about it (see, Ranching is the best solution, The PUNCH, January 23, 2018).<br /><br />Rather than a direct involvement of the Federal Government with the cattle owners, such a subsidy should be given to the relevant states, just as the Federal Government did in 2016 when tomato farmers suffered heavy losses due to the infestation of their farms by Tuta Absoluta, otherwise known as tomato ebola.<br /><br />The Federal Government’s vacillation on this issue has adversely affected public opinion about President Muhammadu Buhari and his administration. It will be a major development to the President’s advantage if he could follow through on his recent promise to put an end to the conflict between herdsmen and farmers. However he may want to go about the solution, it must be made clear to him that the idea of cattle colonies is out of the question.<br /><br /><b>By: Niyi Akinnaso</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Empowering Farmers Through Digital Platforms",
    "content": "<br />Start-ups are using digital platforms to change the face of agriculture and help the farming community. DANIEL ESSIET reports.<br /><br />The Group Managing Director of Ogunmod Farms located in Ile-Ogbo, Osun State and in Ibadan, Oyo State,Mr. Pelumi Salas Aribisala is a successful young farmer.<br /><br />The BSc. Microbiology graduate from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Aribisala, farms cassava&nbsp; and&nbsp; other&nbsp; crops.<br /><br />Aribisala’s income is huge and certain. This is because he&nbsp; discovered&nbsp; the secret to a prosperous&nbsp; agro business. He belongs to&nbsp; online&nbsp; platforms including Agroshop&nbsp; that connects farmers&nbsp; to the agricultural supply and value chain and provides them with critical information on weather, market prices and incoming opportunities via text messages.<br /><br />His strategy is to&nbsp; explore innovative ways to improve food production. If you walk past the fields, sometimes, you will find him&nbsp; &nbsp;using his&nbsp; smartphone to get market information. This helps him grow and sell his crops and it’s revolutionising&nbsp; his&nbsp; farming and marketing skills. With real-time information that the platform provides, he is able to make better decisions to adapt to climate variability by adjusting the planting time and making better use of fertiliser. The platforms significantly enhance his knowledge and productivity, ultimately leading to higher output and prosperity.<br /><br />Sometimes, cassava prices shot up and&nbsp; Aribisala taps into the situation&nbsp; by exploring the market through his smart phone to get better prices.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ufaUdMUr8c/WdcysZOWGuI/AAAAAAAAAQU/xNE0AEWEzb05NoT3i7P0ATQPp7jASlu-ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers-planting-seedlings.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ufaUdMUr8c/WdcysZOWGuI/AAAAAAAAAQU/xNE0AEWEzb05NoT3i7P0ATQPp7jASlu-ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers-planting-seedlings.jpg\" /></a></div><br />According to analysts, the greatest impact digital agriculture will have is on democratisation of market pricing and compressing transaction costs so that farmers capture a higher portion of the produce marketable value.<br /><br />For&nbsp; Aribisala,&nbsp; there is much in value at stake with inspiring innovations driving agricultural productivity and increasing participation.<br /><br />Through data devices and online platforms, Aribisala gets crucial information on disease outbreak,&nbsp; improved seeds, fertiliser, and pesticides, weather changes, and the current market prices for produce. This, not&nbsp; only helps farmers like him turn out greater yields, but also cuts off the exploitation of farmers by middlemen via making them to be aware of fair market prices.<br /><br />For watchers, a big wave of transformation is coming to the agric industry from data science. This is helping farmers get the best from farming. Updates and reliable information sent to individual farmers’ mobile phones supported many farmers to increase their productivity.<br /><br />In the last three years, a slew of big-data startups are empowering farmers to plan operations, from sowing to predicting crop yields. One of the companies is&nbsp; Probityfarms. The company&nbsp; has&nbsp; developed an App that will connect farmers and broaden knowledge base of stakeholders in the sector.<br /><br />Co-founder and CEO of Probityfarms, Mr. Olushola Ogunniyi, explained that the new technology is a simple-to-use farm management app to help farmers manage both the day-to-day activities of the farm and even the business-side of their operations. Farmers, he said, can use the application throughout the value chain of all farming activities.<br /><br />Ogunniyi said: “We understand that there are two sides to running successful farming; the business side and the technical side. However, many farmers today lack the professional and business skills needed to manage these two farm operations successfully.<br /><br />“With Probity Farms, our pilot farmers depended on our simple dashboard to solve these important needs. After creating their farm profiles, they can easily capture all activities on the farm, from crop production, livestock production and farm economics.<br /><br />“The tools enable them to measure and track every activity in the farm, thereby enabling the farmer to plan better and make sound decision and not just guess work or native intelligence. They also utilise the platform to communicate, learn, share knowledge, and build their relationship with other farmers.”<br /><br />Giving further insight into the App, he said the solution was divided into seven core offerings based on an assessment of the needs of small holder farmers.<br /><br />Also, he said the App has the ability to help determine test and analysis, saying a very affordable hardware is being currently developed with their partners to evaluate the soil condition for the 13 nutrients required for plant growth, water, sunlight, among others, and analyses the data in order to understand the appropriate nutrient to apply to improve farm yields.<br /><br />From precision farming to an efficient food supply chain, technology is bringing tremendous economic benefits to the sector.&nbsp; An application changing the face of Nigerian agriculture is Zenvus.&nbsp; Zenvus application was&nbsp; developed by&nbsp; Prof&nbsp; &nbsp;Ndubuisi Ekekwe, international&nbsp; scholar and&nbsp; founder of African Institution of Technology.&nbsp; &nbsp;The application measures and analyses soil data such as&nbsp; temperature, nutrients, and vegetative health. It helps&nbsp; farmers apply the right fertiliser and optimally irrigate their farms. The process improves farm productivity and reduces input waste by using analytics to facilitate data-driven farming practices for small-scale farmers.<br /><br />Describing the&nbsp; technology, Ekekwe said: “Our product , Zenvus, is an intelligent solution for farms that use proprietary electronics sensors to collect soil data like moisture, nutrients, pH, among others, and send them to a cloud server via GSM, satellite or Wifi. Algorithms in the server analyse the data and advise farmers on their farming processes like when to apply fertiliser, the type of fertiliser required or when to irrigate the farm.<br /><br />As the crops grow, the system deploys special cameras to build vegetative health of crops which is then used to detect drought stress, pest and diseases on crops. “Another&nbsp; innovator is&nbsp; Farmcrowdy.&nbsp; &nbsp; Farmcrowdy, an agric tech company,unveiled a digital application that is empowering farmers across the country.&nbsp; The Chief Executive Officer Farmcrowdy, Onyeka Akumah, said the organisation decided to create a digital platform to get many people on the programme to understand agriculture and its benefits.<br /><br />Akumah disclosed that the application connects small scale farmers and sponsors investors’ who are ready to produce more food for the country.&nbsp; The platform focuses on assisting them with the latest farming techniques and funds to make their lives more meaningful.<br /><br />Speaking with The Nation, the Executive Director, Agricultural and Rural Management Training Institute(ARMTI),&nbsp; Dr&nbsp; Olufemi&nbsp; Oladunni, said&nbsp; agriculture in Nigeria&nbsp; has many gaps that can be filled by the new wave of agri-tech startups. From improving seed quality to enabling accurate information, he said the sector needs technology&nbsp; to&nbsp; change the face of Nigerian&nbsp; agriculture. He noted that using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) helps&nbsp; farmers to get timely information on agricultural advisories, agricultural marketing and improve their capacity and mitigate risks. According to him, the government realised the enormous potential that technology has to boost the agricultural sector with&nbsp; the&nbsp; &nbsp;inauguration of the Growth Enhancement&nbsp; Scheme(GES). He said there should be digital solutions to help experts and farmers in the rural areas take numbers, analyse them with soil structures, crop patterns and provide the government with accurate data. Oladunni believes&nbsp; agriculture is a data-intense enterprise when one considers soil variability, moisture and nutrient levels, rainfall variability, timing of key operations like planting and harvesting, and market price volatility.Oladunni believes technology will be key to increasing agricultural productivity by delivering tailored recommendations to farmers based on crop, planting date,variety sown, real-time, localised observed weather and projected market prices.<br /><br />The challenge, however, is that the sector lacks rural&nbsp; infrastructure&nbsp; to support the implementation of digital agriculture in areas&nbsp; where farmers live. Digital agriculture, experts said,&nbsp; is&nbsp; sustained&nbsp; by&nbsp; Spatial and Data Infrastructure (SDI) and low-cost smart phones and tablets to support the bi-directional flow of data and information to rural consumers<br /><br /><b>By: DANIEL ESSIET</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why Farmers Should Consider Drip Irrigation — Expert",
    "content": "<br />Drip irrigation is a system whereby you give water or fertiliser directly to the root zone of plants, eliminating runoff, evaporation, and drift. It is a technique in which water flows through a filter into special drip pipes, with emitters located at different spacing.<br /><br />Mr. Adebowole Onafowora, an agricultural entrepreneur, explained that drip irrigation increases oxygen level at the root zone by more than 100 times, adding that although oxygen is not a major nutrient of plants, it aids them in absorbing nutrients and water.<br /><br />Setting up a drip irrigation system for one’s farm involves connecting pipes namely drip lines or drip taps and then water is released through the emitters, releasing about 1.5 litres to 20 litres of water per day depending on the water requirement of the crop.<br /><br />The different types of emitters for irrigation include; micro emitters, porous emitters which are inbuilt from the factory, and free flow emitters also inbuilt from factory, or improvised emitters from used water bottles and other suitable materials.<br /><br />Onafowora said a hectare of land requires N100,000 to N150,000 to do it yourself and with a little extra if you are hiring a professional.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aISld1n54Z4/WeCfEOpVO2I/AAAAAAAAAWc/dZ0B76GrDxUEk7zby-eYMc_ouEX0L7UWwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B24.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"264\" data-original-width=\"176\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-aISld1n54Z4/WeCfEOpVO2I/AAAAAAAAAWc/dZ0B76GrDxUEk7zby-eYMc_ouEX0L7UWwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B24.jpg\" /></a></div>On types of drips to use, he explained that the crop to be grown is the first thing to consider when going into drip irrigation, adding that drip lines that have stronger pipes are those that can last for up to three years or more.<br /><br />He listed types of drip lines to include; the arrow head drip line which is best for root crops or crops that are heavy feeders like tomato, cucumber and pepper, adding that it has been designed to go into the root zone.<br /><br />Then there are surface drip lines suitable for crops like watermelon and vegetables, drip tapes used majorly for irrigation only because they are not suitable for fertiliser (fertigation).<br /><br />The mist spraying drip which is an overhead drip line spraying water from the top is mostly used for foliar irrigation/fertigation of vegetables and leafy crops, he added.<br /><br />He warned that the emitters can get clogged, especially when use for fertigation and that bush burning burns drip lines because they are made of plastic.<br /><br />Onafowora advised farmers to always seek expert counsel on the best emitters to use for the crop he/she intends to grow.<br /><br />He also advised that drip tapes should not be used for more than one harvest season, although they may last for up to six months with good management when carrying out farming activities on the farm.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /><br />Speaking about the limitations, he warned that the emitters can get clogged especially when used for fertigation.<br /><br />Similarly, if there is bush burning, Mr Onafowora said the drip lines may get burnt because the materials are made of plastic, as such, maintenance and close supervision is needed at all times.<br /><br />He said the best way to identify blocked emitters is by scouting; by having someone go through the farm to check and remove the particles that may have caused the blockage.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Strawberry Farming Flourishes in Jos",
    "content": "<br />Mr Elvis Choji harvests strawberry in his farm in Chaha, Jos.<br /><br />Increased strawberry farming on the plateau&nbsp; has dispelled previously held belief that it could not be grown in Nigeria.<br /><br />&nbsp;Nigeria has huge potential for strawberry cultivation, thanks to favourable agro-ecological weather conditions.<br /><br />&nbsp;Since the cultivation started few years ago, strawberry has now found love in the hearts of the people of Chaha community and it is now the most important produce that shapes the economic power of the farmers.<br /><br />Chaha, which is located at the outskirt of Vom in Jos South LGA of Plateau State, is home to large numbers of farmers with only a few people in the community not cultivating the heart-shaped fruit.<br /><br />This reporter went back to see if the farmers he met a few years ago are still farming the fruit and discovered that although the farmers have expanded their farms significantly, the challenges they face are still unresolved.<br /><br />Elvis Choji, and his cousin, Isaac Choji, have remained in cultivation since our reporter met them in 2016 and have even expanded their farms.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5ZalUtbyP30/Wmncg7-Z10I/AAAAAAAABB4/md9VtX1YVwgp_SfvxwVnEYMVxt4LH2SRQCLcBGAs/s1600/Strawberry%2BFarm.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-5ZalUtbyP30/Wmncg7-Z10I/AAAAAAAABB4/md9VtX1YVwgp_SfvxwVnEYMVxt4LH2SRQCLcBGAs/s320/Strawberry%2BFarm.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Elvis’s father, Christopher Choji, a civil servant based in Abuja, has also joined in the cultivation and seems to find better market for his product elsewhere, Elvis said.<br /><br />The cost of fertiliser and insecticides to combat termites, have made it difficult for many of the smallholder farmers in the community to grow.<br /><br />Besides cost of fertiliser and insecticides, the cost of getting water to the farm as well as controlling rodents that destroy the plants are some other challenges the farmers face.<br /><br />With regard to market for their product, many of the farmers still rely heavily on the local women who come to buy the product to hawk along the major Jos highways. Few, however, manage to get theirs to major super markets in Jos and Abuja.<br /><br />Gyang Sunday, an NDII student of Plateau State Polytechnic, who started cultivating strawberry three years ago, told this reporter that he pays his school fees through what he realises from the farm.<br /><br />His farm produces about four cartons every week. Each carton weighs about 5 to 6kg sand a kg sells for N1000 this add ups to approximately N20,000 per week.<br /><br />The farmer, who is in his 20s, said strawberry farming helps him to deal with financial challenges that confront him daily in school, but lamented that the cost of inputs and chemicals to control insects and rodents remain his major challenge.<br /><br />Like others, Polina Abbey makes money selling strawberry along the highway. She is one of the few women giving the farmers hope of remaining in business. They come to the farm every morning to buy from the farmers at N1000 per kg.<br /><br />Whatever profit she makes, according to her, helps to keep their hopes alive for a better future.<br /><br />Although, a farmer does not need to buy the seedlings every farming year, vines after production can be transferred as seedlings to another plot in the new farming season, which does not place any burden on the farmers each planting season.<br /><br />The community has potentials for hundreds of hectares of strawberry farms, which any company or large commercial farmer could simply organize into smallholders to produce for them to export or sell locally. However, help has not come from anywhere yet - not even from the Plateau State government, which could easily attract investment into such venture that gives the state comparative advantage.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Stop Fake Branding of Local Rice",
    "content": "<br />The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Anchor Borrowers’ Programme initiated on November 17, 2015 to boost the production of key agricultural commodities set off a major stampede in small-holder involvement in rice production in many states of the Federation.<br /><br />After its second year, the CBN disclosed that about 300, 000 rice farmers from 20 states had embraced the programme which helped to refocus attention to the fact that Nigeria has the capacity to become a major rice producer and exporter in the world.<br /><br />An innovative experiment which was widely applauded was the memorandum of understanding signed by the Kebbi and Lagos State Governments in which Kebbi would produce rice for sale in the mammoth Lagos market. It was branded LAKE Rice.<br /><br />The success of this experiment made many states to embrace the production of rice branded in the names of their respective states. However, it soon became obvious that some state governors had brought politics and a bit of fraudulent practices into it when states that had no visible or meaningful presence in commercial rice production joined in the fad to brand rice with the names of their states.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sqU5_hO_B2s/Wmm9iimc5YI/AAAAAAAABBo/ELNuYdwAAekyRIbBInOl8zBsjNjPrx_AQCLcBGAs/s1600/ogun-rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"233\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sqU5_hO_B2s/Wmm9iimc5YI/AAAAAAAABBo/ELNuYdwAAekyRIbBInOl8zBsjNjPrx_AQCLcBGAs/s320/ogun-rice.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Allegations arose that some of the states either imported rice and re-bagged/branded them or simply bought trailer-loads of rice from other states and branded them as though such rice was produced in their states. Till date, there is no conclusive evidence that claims by some states to have made millions of dollars from vegetable exports are real.<br /><br />It is very disheartening that some of our elected leaders of today will spare no effort to take false propaganda and fake claims even to areas that have to do with food self-sufficiency. We call on Nigerians to keep their eyes peeled and use every avenue at their disposal to expose these fakers.<br /><br />The taste of the pudding, they say, is in the eating. The only way any state government can prove the veracity of their state brand of rice is to make it abundantly available and affordable within the local markets. Those who import and re-bag under their state brands cannot sustain the fakery because they will run at a huge loss in the long run.<br /><br />States that cannot produce rice in commercial quantity should go into the cultivation of other equally valuable agricultural commodities, such as cassava, cocoa, palm produce, millet, maize and others. There is no need to fake it.<br /><br /><b>Source: Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Should Government Revive Farm Settlements?",
    "content": "<br />It depends on the type of farm settlements being considered. However, what I think is, it is important for the government to get an expanse of land, clear it, make it one in which you can operate tractors, demarcate it into hectares and then allocate it to farmers.<br /><br />The farmers will be able to work on the allocated land under the supervision of experts.<br /><br />Why I say experts here is because there are specialised equipment used in the agricultural sector nowadays.<br /><br />For instance, in the area of cassava farming; we have planters, harvesters and many more. But as it is currently, individual farmers cannot buy some of the equipment mentioned.<br /><br />Now, if such prices of equipment were available, they would reduce the cost of production.<br /><br />The absence of these machines is one major reason why the cost of production in Nigeria is higher than what you see in other countries that are doing well agriculturally. •Mr. Segun Adewumi (The President, Nigeria Cassava Growers Association)<br /><br />My take on the proposal to revive farm settlements is that government needs to be focused. It does not need to dabble into so many things to stretch itself. Looking at it, the present government institutions created to develop agriculture are not functioning. Take a case of the ADC system; it is not properly funded or equipped. We have many failed programmes because the government in the first instance, did not fund, staff, and equip them well. That is one.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yA8qb5BzFbU/WeCfBg-y1aI/AAAAAAAAAWc/jWH3Xl4CWHEGZLRuQxGqMmpc1mSm_FjBACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B%2B10.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"192\" data-original-width=\"263\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yA8qb5BzFbU/WeCfBg-y1aI/AAAAAAAAAWc/jWH3Xl4CWHEGZLRuQxGqMmpc1mSm_FjBACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B%2B10.jpg\" /></a></div><br />The second is the attitude of the personnel that serve in these institutions. The workers are not committed to the ideals of these institutions; everybody is looking for what to grab at a particular time instead of building the institutions.<br /><br />If you look at most states at present, they are setting up parallel structures to these institutions instead of strengthening them.<br /><br />Some states are known to have set up technical committees on agriculture instead of developing agricultural extension systems that are in place.<br /><br />Government should not, in my opinion, contemplate reviving the farm settlements. The programme failed because of leadership failure.<br /><br />It will be a waste of taxpayers’ money. We had so many agricultural programmes in this country; you can name them – from Operation Feed the Nation; Green Revolution; Agricultural Transformation; Green Agriculture; FADAMA, and all sorts of other programmes.<br /><br />If they are not funded by external agencies, they will not work and once external agencies withdraw, those programmes crumble.<br /><br />My recommendation will be that the government should strengthen the existing structure, build the capability of the personnel in these institutions in all ramifications and let them function.<br /><br />Fund them properly and monitor their performance regularly. There should be a regular upgrade of personnel skills.<br /><br />My recommendation will be for them to improve our existing structures, particularly the agricultural extension system so that extension workers will serve the farmers well with new technology, new ways of farming and with new ways of managing their lives. In this way, agriculture can improve.<br /><br />But to begin to revive a structure that collapsed long ago, I don’t think that will work. • Prof. Gabriel Umoh (A Professor of Agricultural and Development Economy, University of Uyo, Akwa Ibom State)<br /><br />It seems we lack adequate comprehension of what the original concept of farm settlements was all about.<br /><br />The original farm settlements as conceived by Baba, Chief Obafemi Awolowo were supposed to be optimum farming communities where the basic necessities of life which would help keep the farmers on the farm were available.<br /><br />In addition to the land they were going to farm on, there was the provision of housing, water supply, source of light and schools and other basic amenities within that farming communities.<br /><br />What we had then was supposed to be a prototype which, with the successes recorded were supposed to be replicated across board.<br /><br />When the idea came about, Nigeria’s population was under 50 million but we have quadrupled that size. We should now be thinking of having plantations but we can have farm settlements where we can groom the younger generation to take interest in agriculture.&nbsp; &nbsp;• Senator Gbenga Kaka (A former Vice Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture)<br /><br />The farm settlements which I knew about in the First and Second Republics were settlements meant for farmers, not for cattle.&nbsp; They were such that there were hospitals and markets within or around and buyers came and bought crops offered for sale. Farmers were provided with comfort to remain in one place in order to cultivate the land. Now, they can even be made better because while you are there, you can communicate with people all over the world using mobile telephones.<br /><br />These farm settlements can be seriously transformed, such that you also make provision for Fulani herdsmen but that is not the cattle colony they are talking about – that is completely ruled out. These cows could be kept somewhere with grass cultivated to feed them. It is even against the animal rights policy for you to make cows trek several kilometres looking for grass to eat or water to drink, when you can keep the animals somewhere and provide these things for them. When an animal treks for 50, 60 kilometres, what do you expect from it apart from low quality protein?<br /><br />We need to modernise our cattle rearing system, such that even the man in Sokoto can house and feed his cattle in such a way that they can no longer threaten crop farmers. We are facing real danger (with open cattle grazing). You cannot eat meat alone; you have garri, yam and vegetables. But very soon, they will no longer be affordable because the cows have finished them all. So, we are going to face an increase in the cost of all these items because of the destruction of farms by cattle.<br /><br />I will advocate an expanded farm settlement culture and policy that will cater for all farmers, whether cattle, goat, pig, fish or arable crop farmers, not in the form of the&nbsp; cattle&nbsp; colony the Federal Government is talking about. By so doing, we are ready to produce cattle of high quality and put all the farms together in an environment where the so-called cattle herdsmen can also benefit from basic education. This is because these farm settlements are supposed to have educational and medical facilities as well as open markets for buying and selling. If this approach is not adopted, Nigeria should prepare for a very serious food crisis that will cut across all aspects of farming. •Sylvanus Oboh (Professor of Animal Science, Ambrose Alli University, Ekpoma)<br /><br />It is strategic for the federal, state and local governments to revive farm settlements. Billions of Nigeria’s foreign exchange is being spent on importation of food annually even when Nigeria has been blessed with abundant arable land and other agricultural potential.<br /><br />Such a development is sad and a dent to productive and ingenious spirit Nigerians are noted for.<br /><br />A farm settlement is otherwise known as a farm estate, where the entire required infrastructure is provided such as: a good road network, irrigation system, tractor, planter and harvester.&nbsp; All these are capital intensive and can only be provided through the government special project vehicle under the direct supervision of the private sector for income generation purpose.<br /><br />For the sustainability of food security in our nation, agribusiness activities need to be organised and managed well in a strategic and well organised and coordinated manner.<br /><br />Farm settlements will enhance productivity of farm produce, provide enough security for the farm and increase the farmer’s profitability. They will also create more job opportunities for our youths and increase government’s internally generated revenue at local, state and federal levels.<br /><br />Reviving farm settlements will also help to solve the Fulani herdsmen/ farmers clashes. Moreover, it will encourage more investors to venture into the sector<br /><br />The above reasons make it expedient for one to opine that the government at all levels should revive farm settlements. • Mr. Ajisefinni Tajudeen (Director, Enterprise Grooming Institute – An agriculture and training institute)<br /><br />Compiled by: Success Nwogu, Okechukwu Nnodim, Etim Ekpimah, and Alexander Okore<br /><br /><b>By: Segun Adewumi, Ajisefinni Tajudeenc</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

In MITROS rice our collective effort brought us 100,000 bags of rice!<br /><br />As one of the farmers involved in the entire process, I am aware that a point a decision was made to historicize this agricultural landmark in our dear state by paying visual homage to Egypt and the pyramids of Kano.&nbsp; Building a pyramid is a feat of engineering genius, an appropriate representation for the work of the Governor Ibikunle Amosun administration.<br /><br />The optics of representation did not, however, mean the exact replication of the engineering mastery of Egypt. So we tested the engineering efficiencies of our own pyramids, before the actual construction and display. We wanted to ensure that our pyramid of rice was strong and the safety of our dignitaries was taken care of. As we worked, we did several test runs one afternoon in broad daylight; and in open view of the public.&nbsp; No secrets, nothing to hide.&nbsp; We tested the structure with unbranded bags of rice, measuring weight and other dimensions to ensure stability and geometric efficiencies.&nbsp; We took pictures of the work in progress, recording different angles and phases of the pyramid.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-waRaivykRtY/WdY-7C60N3I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/Zzq6TSTNh_Y3xRnk989Zv7q5Ap_J-UfJgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-waRaivykRtY/WdY-7C60N3I/AAAAAAAAAJ4/Zzq6TSTNh_Y3xRnk989Zv7q5Ap_J-UfJgCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Rice.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />These pictures we exchanged among ourselves, some of us excited farmers and for our engineering teams, to assess work progress. Unknown to us, this level of conceptualization would befuddle some mindless nay-sayers. Alas, it is now these work pictures that are being bandied around by the idle minds.<br /><br />Whether they like it or not, Ogun State is the story of affirmed success, for where were they when Governor Amosun renewed the landscape of our state, building new roads, creating a new network of possibilities for industrial growth?&nbsp; Are these roads imaginary or real entities that have also provided the ease of travel and transportation for our people?&nbsp; What tree were they climbing as Governor Amosun built the state’s foreign exchange earnings? Ogun State, our state, now owns 75% of the Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), in Nigeria.&nbsp; We are rated as number one among the 36 states of the federation in the percentage improvement of the Internally Generated Revenues between 2014 and 2017.<br /><br />As a farmer who contributed to that success story, I cannot be swayed or distracted by naysayers. The best I can do for them is to advice that they find a new pastime and make effort to be part of the march of progress. We encourage them to move away from mindlessly hopping from tree to tree, howling and hauling falsehoods.<br /><br /><b>Bolarinwa Ojesegun,</b><br /><b>Abeokuta, Ogun State.</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Sokoto State Cattle Breeding Project, the largest of its kind in the West African sub-region, will be inaugurated in May this year, Commissioner for Animal Health and Fisheries Development, Alhaji Tukur Alkali has said.<br /><br />Conducting journalists round the project sites in Sokoto and Rabah LGA of the state, Alkali said the project will improve the genetics of local cattle breeds by ensuring higher milk and beef production while at the same time empowering farmers with modern technique of livestock production.<br /><br />“The government has spent N2.8 billion on the project which was inherited from the immediate past administration of Alhaji Aliyu Wamakko. Of the amount, N1.5 billion was spent on the supply of Argentinean cattle to be used for cross-breeding, construction, training of personnel, security and other logistics while another N1.3 billion was for the procurement of equipment for the project.<br /><br />“The project is the most definite long-term strategy to end farmers-herdsmen clashes as is being experienced across the federation, and in some neighboring West African countries.

    "title": "Ogbeh: FG Will Not Forcefully Take Land for Cattle Colonies",
    "content": "<br />The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, has maintained that the federal government will not forcibly take land from states to kick off cattle colonies.<br /><br />Ogbeh made this known at the weekend when he refuted claims that the programme was initiated to seize farmlands and hand them over to Fulani herdsmen, saying it was not true.<br /><br />According to him, the intention behind the cattle colonies was to provide safe havens for cattle to graze in peace, to be under controlled environment, prevent conflicts between farmers and herdsmen and not to give people’s land to Fulanis.<br /><br />He said: “If any suspicion does arise, it is unintended and regrettable. We never meant and do not have the intention to seize anyone’s land by force. The federal government will not force states to surrender their land or force any of them to do what it does not like to do.<br /><br />“We have agreed to work together to create a new culture of cattle rearing different from what we have today. We are told that it is a custom of the herdsmen to be moving around. The current culture of open grazing is posing serious challenge and not too efficient.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, the Taraba State Government has raised the alarm over plans by a militia group to carry out fresh attacks on villages in the state.<br /><br />Bala Dan Abu, Senior Special Assistant on Media and Publicity to the State Governor, Darius Ishaku, who raised the alarm in Jalingo yesterday, said there are security reports that arms and ammunition are being brought into the state to execute the dastardly act.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Specifically, Abu revealed that a helicopter loaded with arms and ammunition was reported to have landed in Jibu village in Ibi Local Government Area of the state allegedly meant for a militia group planning to carry out attacks in the state.<br /><br />According to him, “A helicopter suspected to be loaded with arms and ammunition is reported to have landed in a place called Jibu, a village located along River Benue, somewhere near Ibi, in Ibi Local Government Area of Taraba State. The arms and ammunition are allegedly meant for a militia group that may be planning an attack on Taraba villages.”<br /><br />The governor’s spokesman further stressed that prior to the tragic attacks in Agatu in Benue State which led to the killings there, similar system of arms delivery occurred but nothing was done to trace and arrest the owners of the helicopter insisting that the development is suggestive of a planned militia attack on the state.<br /><br />“This system of arms delivery was said to have happened prior to the tragic attacks in Agatu in Benue State last year which led to the killings there. Nothing was done to trace and arrest the owners of the helicopter. There may be another planned militia attacks in the offing,” he said.<br /><br />But the state police command has denied knowledge of the arms conveying helicopter and a planned militia attack on the state.<br /><br />Speaking to THISDAY in a telephone interview, the state Police Public Relations Officer (PPRO), David Misal, maintained that the command is yet to be briefed of the development just as he promised to reach out to journalists whenever information is available on the matter.<br /><br />However, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) caucus in the House of Representatives has expressed disappointment with the federal government over what is described as its “tactless handling” of the spate of killings across the country.<br /><br />It said the current situation fosters possibilities of repeated mass killings by herdsmen in Benue, Taraba and other states, adding that the “prevailing spate of killings across the country now mirrors that of failed states.”<br /><br />The House Minority Leader, Hon. Leo Ogor, in a statement said the caucus emphatically blamed the All Progressives Congress (APC) government for gross failure to explore realistic and effective options towards ending such crisis and saving human lives, adding that too many Nigerians are losing their lives to insecurity nationwide while killers still roam free.<br /><br />He said: “The first fundamental duty of any government is the security of citizens’ lives and property, but it is deeply unfortunate, historically horrific and spiritually negative that under the APC government, the country is witnessing endless rounds of senseless killings of men, women and children in Benue, Taraba and other states.<br /><br />“Within the past two years, unidentified herdsmen have displaced Boko Haram in terms of mindless killings; it is unfortunate that once again, just like they did several times before, rampaging herdsmen in utter contempt for Benue state’s anti-grazing law wantonly descended on Guma and Logo Local Government Areas of Benue State in a new year attack that left scores of dead bodies.<br /><br />“Herdsmen now rank high on the Global Terrorism Index and nationwide, mindless killings, armed robberies and dastardly kidnapping have increased under the APC government which now repays the overwhelming votes from the people with long conspiratorial silence and numb promises while the number of corpses mount.<br /><br />“Security is one of the three major commitments that the APC government guaranteed the country at its inception but in the usual pattern of elevating deceit and propaganda above all else, it has woefully remained unable to rein in worsening insecurity across the country.<br /><br />“Today, the result is that our gallant military personnel and other security operatives are immersed in tackling crises in all parts of Nigeria.”<br /><br />The caucus further bemoaned a situation whereby big farmers in the North now avoid their own farms for fear of kidnappers, stressing that “the APC has insensitively chosen a very wrong and unfair moment in history to announce plans for re-election campaigns.”<br /><br />Also, PDP lawmaker in the House representing Kabba/Bunu/Ijumu federal constituency of Kogi State, Hon. Tajudeen Yusuf, has cautioned Governor Yahaya Bello to tread cautiously and avoid taking unilateral decisions over the adoption of the federal government’s cattle colony initiative.<br /><br />He said: “Several groups and individuals, including members of the governor’s party in the state may turn it into a combustible issue as they are already mobilisng to ensure a strong perception of the governor’s moves on the cattle colony initiative as a colossal unilateral and insensitive decision.”<br /><br />Yusuf, who is&nbsp; the Chairman, House Committee on Capital Market and Institutions, said the “PDP will not support concession of any community’s land for the cattle colony initiative, he also stated that PDP is the only hope for ensuring justice for all those unjustifiably affected by the ongoing sack of workers by the Kogi state government.”<br /><br />He told journalists: “This is beyond politics, I plead with our governor to please make adequate consultations because traditional rulers are not bona fide owners of land in communities in most, if not all communities across Kogi State.”<br /><br />The lawmaker emphasised that instead of despairing, many victims of Kogi State Government’s recent sack may still hope for a better future as the next PDP administration in the state is bound to revisit all genuine cases.<br /><br />He added that if voted into power, the PDP government would upturn the decision of the incumbent administration which sacked thousands of state civil servants recently.<br /><br />According to him: “Between December last year and January this year alone, Kogi State Government which has been having prolonged difficulties in paying salaries sacked 1,774 workers, including eight Permanent Secretaries.<br /><br />“All over the world, teachers are respected because they play a major role in shaping the destiny of future generations but regrettably, in Kogi today, a life of penury and gross uncertainty is their reward.<br /><br />“In 2016, many voters in Kogi State made the mistake of voting for ‘change’ but they now feel gravely shortchanged; we sympathize with many Kogites going through various ordeals, including the recent sack of their family members.<br /><br />“Without the absolutely stupendous billions of Paris Club refund, bailout and federal statutory allocations now coming into Kogi from Abuja, the previous PDP administrations in Kogi State were paying workers’ salaries.<br /><br />“While many critics of the APC administration have attributed the current situation to leadership deficit and blamed people’s harrowing experience on past gullible acceptance of utopian-sounding propaganda and deceitful promises; we feel convinced that there is still cause ahead for hope.”<br /><br /><b>By James Emejo in Abuja and Wole Ayodele in Jalingo</b><br /><b>This day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Will FG’s Plan to Engage Agro-rangers to Protect Farmlands End Herdsmen Attacks?",
    "content": "<br />The proposed agro-rangers which the Federal Government said would lead herdsmen to move their animals from one cattle colony to another cannot stop the atrocities of the Fulani herdsmen. How will that work? How many of them will they engage to move the animals? It is like they want every state in the country to continue to have a share of the atrocities of these herdsmen. This cannot work at all.<br /><br /><b>Which state has not been at the receiving end of these killings? So, the government wants it to spread round that is the way I see it.</b><br /><br />Their agro-rangers cannot stop these people from killing. I have lived for so many years in Europe and I am still a resident of the strongest country in Europe, which is Germany. In Germany, there are so many cattle ranches owned by individuals, you don’t see these cattle and other animals on the road for any reason. In Australia, where the population of animals far exceeds that of human beings, their animals don’t move on the road in search of pasture or for any reason. The ranching system does not make their animals unproductive; they are productive much more than our animals here. I don’t know where the people got this theory from that if their animals don’t move round, they won’t be productive. It is not true. That theory is not scientific at all. Why is there an upsurge in the destruction of farms and killings by herdsmen? Do we have more animals today than we had in the past? Certainly no! There is a scheme and people may not see it. The scheme may be political, religious or anything but there is a scheme. In Australia the number of animals is about 50 times the number of human beings; still their animals don’t roam the streets because they rear them in localised ranches and they make a lot of profit from doing that. Why should our own be different? •Prof. Clement Adebooye (Deputy Vice Chancellor, Osun State University /Agronomist)<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Ya7xNzzUg8/Wd362ZQ8HNI/AAAAAAAAAS0/xHSiSoNvVroc9lZgZA6xxk3l-uVo_bQlACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Agro%2BRangers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Ya7xNzzUg8/Wd362ZQ8HNI/AAAAAAAAAS0/xHSiSoNvVroc9lZgZA6xxk3l-uVo_bQlACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Agro%2BRangers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>I don’t know much about agro-rangers but what I do know is that security remains a cardinal responsibility of the government. Protection of lives and property remains the responsibility of the government. As a representative of Benue citizens, what we need is for the government to guarantee our security. I don’t know how the government will do it but all I know is that the security architecture, as it is at the moment, has not proved to be good enough. I don’t know about rangers and what they should do but I know most Nigerians will agree with me that security is not sufficient and they feel the government is not doing enough to protect them. I recommend reinforcement of security across the nation. I believe that the police and the military are enough. What is lacking is that they are not well equipped and not motivated. If they were equipped and motivated, they would have been able to nip this current crisis in the bud before it escalated to the current level. So, sharing of intelligence, equipping of the police and military would do a lot more than introducing an entirely new institution. I don’t know about the rangers and I hope such a new force will not be abused. It is true that herdsmen move around with sophisticated weapons. For instance in Benue, police personnel have been killed and these are people that went to protect lives and property in Logo. These were policemen that went with AK-47 rifles to protect lives and they were overpowered. So, this may mean that those who killed the policemen may even have more sophisticated weapons. So, it will be stating the obvious to say that the herdsmen are armed. In essence, I don’t know what the agro-rangers will do. •Terna-Kester Kyenge (Member, Benue State House of Assembly)<br /><br />Any decision of the government to protect the state is a welcome development. But if you want to trace the precedence and previous incidence in this country, one will easily tell you that the Federal Government does not seem to be sincere. For now, I will tell you that I believe that the government is playing games and being laconic with the truth, in terms of the security and protection of citizens. Does the government need to wait up till this moment before coming up with the policy now that these attacks have become a recurrent decimal? These people (ranch rangers) you are going to engage, are they not going to be trained? Are they not going to be equipped? Would they not be taken round to know the terrain? Would they not be trained on the modus operandi of the mindless killers? The security agencies already in existence know all these issues. So, it is better for the government to fund them adequately and be sincere.<br /><br />We saw what happened in Benue and people who were killed. So, we would be happy if government does the right thing by protecting its citizenry. With the way these incidents have be taking place, you would know that a powerful bloc has been protecting the Fulani herdsmen and the people behind them. And you can see that it is a kind of an unknown militia because if you look at it, the herdsmen cannot manipulate an ordinary gun. But they are being backed by some mindless persons who have been using them to destroy villages.<br /><br />The farmers who lost their farmlands for which they took loans were not compensated. But the same Federal Government is protecting a private cattle rearer and giving him a colony in a location that is not his. Can you see the insincerity and wickedness against the farmers? So, how does it want the ordinary Nigerian to believe that it is sincere in tackling the issue? It has not come up with a viable option. •Sam Abasilim (A-Benin-based legal practitioner)<br /><br />Frankly speaking, in the world of today, nothing happens without political will. From all indications, this Federal Government, the Presidency and perhaps the Ministry of Agriculture, have their own unique take on how to solve this monstrous problem. I am also aware that the governor of Benue State has his own ideas which are very unique to him which are based on ignorance and irresponsibility.<br /><br />What the Benue State government did with its version of state rangers is worthy of mention here. He recruited thugs and miscreants and gave them enormous powers to seize cattle and collect illegal taxes from herders under the guise of enforcing the anti-grazing law. I don’t know how this will work at the federal level. •Dr. Junaid Muhammed (Ex-Federal Lawmaker)<br /><br />Before saying yes or no, I will like to state a few things, because we don’t think the Federal Government will just decide to leave important things undone. It is very bad to experience what we are facing presently in many parts of the country but it is also important to state that those who rear cattle are farmers as well. They are part of us; everybody is involved in his or her own business. Those who plant are in their business, while those who rear cattle are also in their business and we must all understand this. What we are doing is that we are now trying to echo to the government what should be done. It is not just for you to come up with a policy, the policy has to be implemented. So if the Federal Government believes that the introduction of agro-rangers will solve the problem, then we don’t mind. All we want is peace so that everything can move as expected in the sector. We made our submissions to the government when it came onboard as regards the agricultural sector. We will be happy if the government can think of measures that will solve this lingering problem between herdsmen and farmers.<br /><br />We are not happy at the moment and we want this problem not to repeat itself because most of our farmers cannot feed themselves anymore. Many of them have fled and left their farmlands because of the activities of herdsmen. But I must mention that we are all one and I pray the crisis do not repeat itself as seen in the past again. The policy on agro-rangers can also help but we want to see it implemented adequately in order to curb all the clashes and menace we experience across the country. •Otunba Femi Oke (The Chairman, All Farmers Association of Nigeria)<br /><br /><b>Compiled by:&nbsp; Success Nwogu, Femi Makinde, Eniola Akinkuotu, Okechukwu Nnodim and Alexander Okere</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Cabbage in particular is easy to produce especially if you have sufficient urea fertiliser and pesticides,” said Danladi.<br /><br />He added that not less than 60 bags of cabbage are harvested in an acre with each bag costing N3,000 at the farm.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAm0/5NJJ366GNgYifYf1qVv72Oj0kkoMbVPwwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"182\" data-original-width=\"278\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAm0/5NJJ366GNgYifYf1qVv72Oj0kkoMbVPwwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“At its initial stage, cabbage requires urea fertiliser at least four times in its three months’ life span and application of pesticide at least once in every three days of its early stage of growth,” he stated, adding that they buy seeds from the open market in Bakori, Funtua and sometimes Zaria.<br /><br />Another farmer in the village, Malam Rabo Dare, said the growing interest in irrigation farming in the village has surpassed the capacity of the small river they depended on.<br /><br />“There is need for government or private companies to address the problem of water by establishing boreholes to support the river we are using. Water constraint is limiting our capacity to produce vegetables in large scale,” said Rabo Dare.<br /><br />He explained that they produce sugarcane and cassava in large quantities especially as the two crops require only damp and cool soil to grow.<br /><br />“Because we cannot produce much tomato or Irish potato, we resorted to the cultivation of sugarcane and cassava.<br /><br />“They take much of our time but their water requirement is only at the initial stage; once they shoot up they are bound to survive,” he further explained.<br /><br />&nbsp;He said beside their village, there are many others in the district that are into irrigation farming using rivers close to them.<br /><br />Dauda Sule, a large-scale farmer in Tsiga, told this reporter that there are many villages, such as Unguwar Kanawa, Barebari and Gwamutsawa, that are producing vegetables in large scale courtesy of their small rivers.<br /><br />“Many of us now explore opportunities in irrigation farming which in the past was left to the selected few who operated only at irrigation dam sites,” Sule said.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmud,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Readily Available Grasses Farmers Can Grow",
    "content": "<br />Pasture production is simple and does not require too much skill to practice. It is important for owners of both large and small animals to key into it for sustainability of livestock production in Nigeria.<br /><br />The most important and readily available grasses to grow are:<br /><br />1. Congo grass, Brachiaria riziziensis, which is a very important forage specie with fast growth at the beginning of the wet season due to its strong seedling vigour, ease of establishment, with good yield and seed production. The recommended seed rate is 25kg to 30kg per hectare and it has the ability to suppress weeds.<br /><br />2. Chloris gayana, otherwise known as Rhodes grass should be planted at 15kg to 20kg of seeds per hectare. It could be cultivated both as a palatable pasture for animals and a groundcover to reduce erosion.<br /><br />3. ‘Gamba’ grass is suited to most soil types except for heavy clays. It should be planted at the rate of 60kg to 100kg of seeds per hectare.<br /><br />4. Pennisetum pedicilatum, known as desho grass, and popularly called annual kyasuwa grass in Nigeria, has a high biomass producing capacity and grows upright with the potential of reaching 90cm to 120cm in height depending on soil fertility. It should be planted at the rate of 60kg to 80kg of seeds per hectare.<br /><br />5. Brachiaria decumbens, Digitaria smutsii, Elephant grass and Napier grass are all propagated vegetatively at 500 sq. metre each per hectare of land.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-purRX--28TI/WmCWD0ymWGI/AAAAAAAABAQ/JdfJbybyLzghn2OeZ5j6mo9jS7TVDAnLwCLcBGAs/s1600/Grass.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-purRX--28TI/WmCWD0ymWGI/AAAAAAAABAQ/JdfJbybyLzghn2OeZ5j6mo9jS7TVDAnLwCLcBGAs/s320/Grass.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />For all the aforementioned grasses, drilling method of planting should be used for planting at a spacing of 0.5m to 1m apart. This is because of their ability to tiller i.e. ability to have several branches.<br /><br />Similarly, leguminous plants that could be cultivated for feeding livestock include Lablab, which should be planted at seeds rate of 25kg per hectare, that is, 2-3 seeds per hole with spacing of 30cm x 60cm.<br /><br />Centrosema, Alyscarpus and Stylo, uses 10-15kg per hectare and should be drilled at 0.5m apart.<br />Information given by Mr Yunusa M Ishiaku, a researcher on pasture production at the National Animal Production Research Institute (NAPRI) in Shika, Zaria.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

As such, importing countries of the world need phytosanitary certificate to accompany Nigerian plant exports.<br /><br />For someone going into export, it is important to find out the standard of the country you wish to export to.<br /><br />Secondly, proper documentation of key documents like products description, quantity, packaging, etc. is needful.<br /><br />A phytosanitary certificate confirms that quarantine inspection has been carried out by the accredited officers of the Nigerian Agricultural quarantine Service (NAQS) and the consignment of plants/plant is pest-free at the time of examination.<br /><br />It also states whether or not any form of treatment has been carried out on the consignment. This certificate is vital for the export to be accepted into the importing country.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1bTewFZvkSU/WmCViJONiqI/AAAAAAAABAI/xJBf_sK-T14397wP-lUURUliztGDYbf6QCLcBGAs/s1600/Plant.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1bTewFZvkSU/WmCViJONiqI/AAAAAAAABAI/xJBf_sK-T14397wP-lUURUliztGDYbf6QCLcBGAs/s320/Plant.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Prior to issuance of this certificate, prospective exporters need to request for phytosanitary inspection of their consignments by filling the appropriate forms and payment of a token fee. Each consignment needs its phytosanitary certificate.<br /><br />Another key thing to get is laboratory certification detailing contents such as pesticides, microbes, mycotoxins, including physical attributes like shape, colour, moisture, dust and particles content.<br /><br />The consignment also has to be traceable and from registered farms with history of seedlings/cuttings, and with proper nutritional quality. In addition, proper labelling specifying details like shelf life, storage temperature etc. is also critical.<br /><br />The next thing to do is to notify local regulatory authorities and the off-takers of the consignment abroad of the intended export. Doing this ensures that the final checks as to documentations pertaining a particular product is met.<br /><br /><b>Source: <a href=\"http://www.naqs.gov.ng/importexport-requirements/plant.html\">http://www.naqs.gov.ng/importexport-requirements/plant.html</a></b><br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

They’ve stolen all the cables and generators. But we heard that the Federal Ministry of Water Resources is trying to see how it can fix them,” he said.<br /><br />Daily Trust gathered that SCC Nigeria Limited, the company that constructed the project, provided the security for the facilities but withdrew its men after the project was handed over to the Federal Ministry of Water Resources.<br /><br />Source told Daily Trust that the ministry also at some point employed security men to guard the equipment but stopped paying them and they left leaving security in the hands of the farmers who could hardly shoulder the responsibility.<br /><br />Although the area is barricaded by men of the Civil Defence Corps, Alhaji Abdulrahman stressed that “that doesn’t change anything because the problem (theft) still persists.”<br /><br />On the soil situation, the big-time farmer, said they spend a lot of money to put the soil in order, adding that many farmers left because the losses were too much for them to continue with the farming activities.<br /><br />Idris Abdulkadir, another farmer, concurred stating that “most of the cables and parts in the centre pivots were stolen, and in some places the soil does not give good yield which is why many people after one year or two had to leave.”<br /><br />The agro-irrigation project has 6,000 hectares of farmland which will accommodate both smallholder and commercial farmers when fully developed. It has potential of 12,000 hectares.<br /><br />The project was executed by two companies -SCC Nigeria Limited that handled 4,000 hectares, and Salini Nigeria Limited which developed 2,000 hectares.<br /><br />Source at the Federal Ministry of Water Resources said they were aware of the faulty equipment but assured that efforts were already on to fix them.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Ogbeh Defines ‘Cattle Colonies,’ Ranches as Panacea to Farmers-Herders Crisis",
    "content": "<br />In the last few days there has been fierce debate as the Federal Government, which earlier promoted the idea of cattle ranch, opted for ‘cattle colonies’ leaving many people to ask what cattle colony is.<br />The introduction of cattle colonies came following the recent harvest of deaths in rural communities across Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba States blamed on suspected herdsmen.<br /><br />The minister of agriculture and rural development, Chief Audu Ogbeh took his time on Thursday to explain to Nigerians his concept of ‘cattle colonies’ and how that defers from cattle ranch.<br /><br />&nbsp;“Colonies and ranches are the same thing in many ways except that a colony is bigger that a ranch; a colony is a biological expression for any species of animals whether by nature or by human design that are found in a large community sharing the same terrain, such as bee colonies in certain areas.<br /><br />“In Colony&nbsp; &nbsp;20, 30 ranchers can share the same colony, a ranch is usually owned by an individual or company with few numbers of cows, in a cattle colony you could find 100, 200, 300 cows owned by different individuals,” Chief Ogbeh stated.<br /><br />He added “The reason for designing colony was that we want to prepare on a large scale, a place where many owners of cattle can co-exist there, they feed well because we can make their feeds from agro waste, get good water to drink as cows drink a lot of water, we can give them green fodder; we grow it on a large scale harvest and feed the cow; give them veterinary services and protect the cows against rustlers”.<br /><br />However, since declaring the policy last week, there have been outrage and overt opposition by some section of the society that government has hidden agenda to forcefully amass communal land nationwide for prowling herdsmen -a charge chief Ogbeh denies.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>&nbsp;Audu Ogbeh, while explaining the concept said that there was no truth in the speculation that government was conspiring to grant supremacy over communal land to Fulani herdsmen.<br />“Cattle colony is not using Fulani herdsmen to colonize any state. It is going to be done in partnerships with state governments that would like to volunteer land for it. Federal government will fund the project and those wishing to benefit from it will pay some fees,” the minister reiterated.<br />He declared that the idea of the cattle colony was envisaged as a measure to tackle the herdsmen-farmers conflicts and a platform for government to make more commitments to the development of the livestock subsector.<br /><br />According to the Minister, while cattle ranching is more of an individual venture for the herdsmen and those wishing to invest in the livestock sector, cattle colonies is a larger project where up to 40 ranchers can share same facility that will be provided by the government at a reduced rate.<br /><br />Speaking further “ranching is more of individual venture for those who want to invest, but cattle colony is bigger in scope and size. It is going to be done in partnership with states government who wish to be part of it. Already 16 states have volunteered land. Nobody is going to seize land from any community for the project”, he noted.<br /><br />Ogbeh said once the colony begins, the Federal Government would embark on a large scale artificial insemination to improve the breed of cattle so that the yield of milk can increase.<br /><br />&nbsp;He observed that while a cow in Nigeria delivers about a litre of milk per day, in East Africa, a cow gives 15 litres of milk and in Europe they do averagely 50 litres of milk per day,, saying that Nigeria is still&nbsp; a long way from&nbsp; achieving the target which other countries have achieved.<br /><br />He sought for supports from states in area of extension officers who will be recruited within the locality so that they can be in contact with rural farmers, they will be taught on what to do as well as train the farmers on planting operations which will go side by side with the programme on cattle colonies.<br /><br />The Minister also&nbsp; &nbsp;announced that the Federal Government would soon hold a stakeholders’ forum with the herdsmen and other stakeholders on the implementation of the new policy.<br /><br />In 2016, the Federal Government promised to grass-up 50,000 hectares of land across the federation with improved grass seed imported from Brazil in land provided by state governments and some of the grazing reserves.<br /><br />That programme did not happen and the ministry blamed it on lack of funds and the opposition and criticism it received by many stakeholders including the herdsmen.&nbsp;<br /><br />Dr Ochinya Ojiji, a Peace Conflict Resolution expert, who has worked extensively in solving the problem between herders and farmers in some states in the past said the herders/farmers clashes have been going on for a long time but the country has failed to find lasting solutions to it.<br /><br />The expert noted that places like Kenya in East Africa where animal rearing is part of their lifestyle also experienced similar problems because of cattle movement due to dry weather and climatic conditions.<br /><br />He however opined that the country needs to employ an early warning mechanism which will track the movement of animals from one region to the other, affirming that with this, such conflict has been managed in East Africa because they have been able to contain the animals.<br /><br />Dr Ojiji stressed that “What we need to bear in mind is that this is a practice that has been going on for a very long time, in other words the seasonal movement of animals in other parts which is the northern to southern part is ongoing and is as a result of change in the climatic condition; and anytime it becomes dry in the north you should know that they are due to move so why don’t we learn something from what is been going on from East Africa.”<br /><br />He explained that the purpose of early warning mechanism is to track the movement of animals so that people will be at alert including the security agencies that this is the period where animals begins to move from one region to the other.<br /><br />“The issue of ranches being discussed is a very delicate one. The infrastructure needed is not there at the moment so if you put in place the law of banning cattle grazing then what happens since there are no infrastructures? even the politicians who were accumulating animals through gifts or donations given to them, they have&nbsp; large number of cows now, they are the ones that have these animals and they have given them to Fulani’s to&nbsp; help rear them on their behalf have not even be able to put in place the ranches people are suggesting.<br /><br />“How can we begin to say the small scale cattle rearers should go into ranches, how do they do it? So for me, banning open grazing is an unworkable solution because the real cattle rearers will not have the resources to put in place the ranches,” he said<br /><br />On colony he stated that if government can do that, it would be wonderful however noted that “it’s also a cultural practice of the people and the whole idea of moving is like a way of life of the people. So in the immediate time it may be difficult to&nbsp; contain them in one&nbsp; particular colony as suggested, but maybe in the&nbsp; long run it&nbsp; will work out but they have to be patient seek understanding from both parties because the reality is that the cattle rearing business is an important component of our economy life.”<br /><br />A think Tank group led by Professor Ibrahim Gambari, General Martin Luther Agwai (Rtd), Professor Jibrin Ibrahim, Professor Attahiru Jega and others in a Memorandum published last week noted that “the Nigerian livestock industry is largely dependent on natural vegetation. Although there is a vast hectare of natural vegetation in the country they are not maximally utilized due to poor planning and conflicting government policies. It was estimated that there are over 40 million hectares of grazing land in Nigeria, out of which only 3 million hectares are specifically tagged as grazing reserves.”<br /><br />They stressed and suggested that “the idea to encourage nomads to settle was first made in 1942 but never implemented. A clear policy of land grant to pastoralists should be developed and implemented by state governments.”<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "content": "<br />The Federal Government has concluded plans to create more than one million jobs across the country through egg production, processing and marketing under the National Egg Production (NEGPRO) scheme.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), Chief Audu Ogbeh, who disclosed this recently at a meeting with the Technical Committee on NEGPRO in Abuja, hopes that the scheme would facilitate the country’s attainment of self-sufficiency in egg production.<br /><br />According to him, the scheme would be inaugurated in Ondo State and subsequently in other states across the country. He added that the ministry would work with the committee and with the support of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN).<br /><br />He said the ministry would achieve the goal of the scheme, stating that unless people deal with the problem of food, Africa cannot survive.<br /><br />Also speaking at the meeting, Chairman of the committee and Director, Animal Husbandry in the ministry, Mr. Toyin Taiwo, said the programme would enhance egg production processing and consumption across the country.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RmB_cOxSvtw/WlYjBSEZmbI/AAAAAAAAA_I/cl0FPNlNaXk-HZsayQz4xcJFpriQlwN6ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Eggs.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"208\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-RmB_cOxSvtw/WlYjBSEZmbI/AAAAAAAAA_I/cl0FPNlNaXk-HZsayQz4xcJFpriQlwN6ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Eggs.jpg\" /></a></div>He explained that the programme would accelerate the nation’s economic diversification policy, and further raise the contribution of agriculture to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).<br /><br />He said, “the scheme is for the period of five years and at full operation nationwide, it is expected to provide about 50 million table eggs daily for local consumption, export, processing into egg powder for use in confectioneries and pharmaceuticals.”<br /><br />However, Chairman of Tuns Farms Limited and National Anchor of the scheme, Chief Tunde Badmus, disclosed that the CBN would provide farmers with loans to begin egg production.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Farmers Abandon Wheat Farms Over Inputs",
    "content": "<br />Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN) has said that lack of improved seeds forced farmers in Gombe State to abandon their initial plans of cultivating 10,000 hectares of wheat farms in the state.<br /><br />Speaking in Gombe recently, the state WFAN Chairman, Batari Dauda, also lamented that post-harvest losses, lack of quality seeds and other inputs as well as non-availability of farming implements are part of key factors hindering wheat production in the country.<br /><br />He stated: “Our cultivation is limited by lack of quality seeds and farming implements. Most of our farmers complained that the available seeds have been planted and replanted for over five years. This has resulted in deterioration in terms of crop quality, as the crop yield will not be good.”<br /><br />However, he bemoaned that good quality seeds, when available, are not enough for distribution to the farmers.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UkrGxrq5SHY/WjurnFsFIvI/AAAAAAAAA9s/g9h-OZeotHYUO-Eyp97YEouEUx_TIIh_gCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Wheat.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UkrGxrq5SHY/WjurnFsFIvI/AAAAAAAAA9s/g9h-OZeotHYUO-Eyp97YEouEUx_TIIh_gCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Wheat.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>He explained: “Initially, Lake Chad Research Institute brought us foundation seeds but the problem we had then was that the seeds, which were of good quality, were not sufficient. Those farmers who were able to plant the crop early enough harvested three to four tonnes on each hectare of farmland, while those that planted late realised between one and two tonnes per hectare.”<br /><br />While exhorting wheat farmers to always patronise certified seed producers, Dauda blamed the high prevalence of sub-standard wheat seeds in the country to preference for roadside dealers over registered agro-inputs dealers by farmers.<br /><br />He, therefore, called on the federal and state governments to intervene in efforts to boost wheat production in order to meet local demands.<br /><br />He urged the Federal Government to show seriousness in its quest to diversify the country’s economy through agriculture.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Low Cost Agric Investments That Can yield Huge Income",
    "content": "<br />Already, there are thousands of opportunities within Nigeria’s agric sector and people who have decided to look into that direction are smiling to the banks frequently with wholesome profits from their various farming businesses.<br /><br />For instance, during the recent recession, agriculture was one of the sectors that experienced tremendous growth, which shows that if you’re looking for a sector to invest in 2018, you should not think twice before considering agriculture.<br /><br />Therefore, for beginners, there are some areas of investments in the sector, which costs are generally low, and the returns on investment are indisputable and decent. It is advisable for intending farmers to seek experts’ advise and undergo training before going into any farming business in Nigeria.<br /><br /><b>Mushroom farming</b><br /><br />The cultivation of mushroom is one of the most money-spinning agricultural jobs in Nigeria but people are yet to explore the potential despite the country’s conducive climate for high volume of mushroom production.<br /><br />Mushroom is an essential vegetable, which regularly grows in the forest with medicinal value. It is rich in protein, Vitamin B, and minerals, phosphorus and also has a large global demand.<br /><br />Mushroom is cultivated and sold commercially in over 60 countries like the US, France and Poland, among others. Setting up a mushroom farm requires little space and can be started with between N10,000 and N40,000 depending on how big you want your mushroom farm to be. Some mushroom farmers are making up to N4 million annually.<br /><br /><b>Quail farming</b><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lGcLsYoTv3k/Wlx8IeOhqZI/AAAAAAAAA_k/XtO4RwTuhSAKDhAtuwT5SZXcqbLFRYEFQCLcBGAs/s1600/AGRIC-300x277.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"277\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lGcLsYoTv3k/Wlx8IeOhqZI/AAAAAAAAA_k/XtO4RwTuhSAKDhAtuwT5SZXcqbLFRYEFQCLcBGAs/s1600/AGRIC-300x277.jpg\" /></a></div>Quail farming can be a lucrative business like other farming ventures, such as chicken, turkey or duck farming in Nigeria. But rearing of quail is still an uncommon business in the country because the bird is one of the smallest poultry birds.<br /><br />Ironically, just few people are into the business of the ‘little wonder bird’, as many people call it, and making cool cash. These sets of people are also enjoying both the nutritional and health values derived from consuming the meat and the eggs of the bird. It is on record that some farmers are making between N700,000 and N1.3 million every year from raising quail birds for meat, eggs and hatchery production.<br /><br />Due to its nutritional values and health benefits, experts predicted that quail would soon take over the chicken poultry business. Starting quail farming requires a little capital of N20,000. The low cost of investment in rearing quail and the high rate of returns are some of the reasons you should venture into quail farming in 2018.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Grasscutter farming</b><br /><br />Grasscutter farming is another lucrative livestock breeding business that an intending farmer or investor who is looking towards making money should consider going into in 2018.<br /><br />This is the time to invest in this emerging niche, as the demand for the animal is everywhere. For now, demand for breeding colonies and table size are not being met and it will remain so for a while.<br /><br />The switch to white meat by many people, especially rich men, is increasing the demand for grasscutter significantly. Even hotels, restaurants, pepper soup joints are in search of steady supply of grasscutter but unfortunately, the supply is still very short and unavailable.<br /><br />Investigations have revealed that with N50,000, one can start the business. All potential farmers need is some practical training on how to handle them. 500 grasscutters can earn you between N2 million and N2.75 million as a market-ready grasscutter is sold for between N4,000 and N5,500.<br /><br /><b>Butternut squash farming</b><br /><br />This is the right time for potential farmers to invest in butternut squash farming in Nigeria. The crop is still not common in the country and people are already demanding for it because of its numerous health benefits. The few people who are planting the crop in the Southwest cannot satisfy local demands let alone international market.<br /><br />Presently in Nigeria, people can only get butternut squash from shoprite and some other big shopping malls across the country even as the supply is below demand as it is not always available on demand in those shopping malls.<br /><br />Once a farmer gets a land, he needs a little capital of N70,000 to start the business.<br /><br /><b>Maggot farming</b><br /><br />With the high cost of animal feed growing, maggots farming is beginning to become a thriving business, as experts say that African entrepreneurs have huge opportunity to make millions from it.<br /><br />In South Africa today, they longer use fishmeal to prepare feed for livestock because they have estimated that if they continue to catch fish from the sea, by 2020 or 2025, fishes may go into extinction as demand for livestock keep increasing.<br /><br />But in Nigeria, the new business opportunity is yet to be explored as people still doubting it. But there is money in maggots farming and needs a little capital of N35,000 to N40,000 to start after receiving training from an expert.<br /><br /><b>Heliculture farming (snail farming)</b><br /><br />Commercial snail farming has become an alternative for livestock farmers as it offers them new business opportunities. Snail farming is thriving at the moment in Africa because it was neglected and overlooked.<br /><br />Snail breeding can yield quick money if the farmer understands the nitty-gritty of the modern techniques and type of species that are in high demand in Europe, USA and other developed countries.<br /><br />However, the rising consciousness of the elite to choose healthy diets has made snails popular features of expensive meals in hotels, bars, restaurants and shopping malls.<br /><br />In terms of cost and time, snail farming is a low risk business and profitable. Unlike many other livestock businesses, snail farming requires very little startup capital of about N60,000 or N100,000 depending on the size of your farm. N100,000 snails, after a year or two, sold at the rate of N50 each (highly reduced price) will give you about N5 million.<br /><br /><b>Vegetables farming</b><br /><br />The fresh vegetable business is a small-scale business that you can start with little or no capital base. Vegetable farming requires no cost of maintenance to run the business. Also, there is always demand for fresh leafy vegetables such as waterleaf, scent leaf, pumpkin (ugu) leaf, green leaf, cucumber and watermelon, among others. To start this business, you need a small space in your compound or nearby farm where you can cultivate the vegetables. It takes between four to six weeks or less for the vegetables to mature for harvest.<br /><br /><b>Cassava farming</b><br /><br />One of the cash crops you must consider in 2018 is cassava because the demand for cassava products in Nigeria is on the rise. After getting a land, you need about N45,000 N55,000 to get quality cassava stems for planting. By-products such as garri, fufu and bread, are the daily staple foods of almost every Nigerian and 95 per cent of Nigerian households consume one of these meals everyday.<br /><br />The numerous uses of cassava for meals, industrial starch and even for alcohol has made its demand far exceed its supply and as such, many local farmers are reaping good profits from growing this crop, which has overtime made it one of the most profitable agricultural business ideas any intending farmer can start.<br /><br /><b>By Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Nigeria is set for a bunper yam harvest, farmers have said.The Yam Farmers, Processors and Marketers Association of Nigeria is promising increased yam production&nbsp; &nbsp;to support&nbsp; the Federal Government’s&nbsp; yam export initiative.<br /><br />Its Acting President, Prof Simon Irtwange,&nbsp; in an interview in Abuja, said farmers had been mobilised to increase their production to provide for consumption and export.<br /><br />Irtwange, who chairs the Technical Committee on Nigeria Yam Export Programme, said efforts were made to build the capacity of yam aggregators to buy exportable yams in large quantities from farmers.<br /><br />He said exporters, instead of going to markets, could procure&nbsp; yams from the aggregators who&nbsp; knew exportable yams’ standards.<br /><br />He said the committee was partnering the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike, for the production of&nbsp; exportable yams’ seedlings to boost the production.<br /><br />“I will not agree that export has anything to do with local production because not every yam variety can be exported.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JcjiKOdDE3Q/Wd_TGRiHLVI/AAAAAAAAAT8/g4Hcp5rln8gQTT_z901eBull3-8sllj9ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Yam.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JcjiKOdDE3Q/Wd_TGRiHLVI/AAAAAAAAAT8/g4Hcp5rln8gQTT_z901eBull3-8sllj9ACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Yam.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“The ones that are exportable are the ones that meet export standards. The export requirements include 2kg. yams that are slender and smooth, while the non-export yams are for consumption.<br /><br />“We have also encouraged yam production; this year, we would have more output than what we had in the previous year because farmers are now sensitised and they have gone into massive production. So, there will be enough yams for the local market and export,” Irtwange said.<br /><br />He said the association had selected the yam varieties it wanted to promote for export but getting the their seedlings was a major challenge.<br /><br />This, he said, was why the association was partnering the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, to produce the seedlings. He added that the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) is also involved in the project.<br /><br />“After production, we have aggregators who will off-take the yams from the farmers and will aggregate for the exporters,’’ he said.<br /><br />Irtwange, who noted that over 20 per cent of exportable yams often rot away because of poor preservation techniques, said&nbsp; aggregators would have cooling systems for the produce.<br /><br />“Concerning the aggregators, what we require from them is that they will have warehouses, they will have cooling systems and they will store the yams under the correct temperature.<br /><br />“Through that way, we can also give assurance of the quality of what we are exporting.<br /><br />“The assurance is that we have done the trials, we have learnt from our mistakes and we have put in place measures to correct all the drawbacks,” Irtwange said.<br /><br />According to him, the essence of the trials was to see where there are challenges so that the assocaition&nbsp; can address them.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Akpen Leva, urged Benue citizens to unite irrespective of tribe, political and religious differences in order to tackle their enemies.<br /><br />Leva described the attack as a “genocide” that was targeted at exterminating the Tiv’s.<br /><br />Former Military Governor, Katsina State, Gen. Lawrence Onoja (rtd) also described the attacks as “a conspiracy against the indigenes” and said it would be resisted.<br /><br />Also in a funeral eulogy, Sen. Joseph Waku, said the state has had enough of the senseless killings saying ”enough is enough”.<br /><br />One of the survivors, Mr Akaater Azera, said that the herdsmen came in the night while they were asleep and started shooting sporadically.<br /><br />According to him, when his wife came out, the gun-toting men shot and killed her on the spot.<br /><br />Azera added that when he ran out of the house, he was pursued, with machete cuts inflicted on his face and leg.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Saleh Alhassan, who appeared on Channels TV morning programme, Sunrise Daily, insisted that the Fulani were not responsible for the attacks that led to the death of over 70 people in the state.<br /><br />Spokesman for the organisation, Alhaji Yusuf Ardo,&nbsp; in a statement, few days ago, indicated that the killings were carried out by “irresponsible elements” and not Fulani herdsmen as being projected in the media.<br /><br />According to Alhassan, “We are peace loving people and that informed our choice of court of law to seek justice and pronouncement that will halt the implementation of anti-open grazing law in the state.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6LrFyM6sxaE/WfrZ7bDFzRI/AAAAAAAAAnU/511BwHAH85YQGDh2Y5f7zbiZupz99pEJgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cattle%2BBreeders.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6LrFyM6sxaE/WfrZ7bDFzRI/AAAAAAAAAnU/511BwHAH85YQGDh2Y5f7zbiZupz99pEJgCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Cattle%2BBreeders.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“While the litigation was ongoing, we wrote and called the attention of all state and non state actors, to prevail on the governor to stop the implementation of the law, but nothing happened.”<br /><br />Alhassan said it was unfortunate that some people pretending to be Fulani have misled the Benue state governor, Samuel Ortom, with fake promise to secure the support of Fulani pastoralists for the anti-open grazing law which, obviously, is in total violation of their culture.<br /><br />He continued,&nbsp; “For instance, the governor kept mentioning Garus Gololo. He belongs to Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeder Association, which is an organization that is open to all that rare cattle and not Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore which is the socio-cultural organization of the Fulani people.<br /><br />“We equally have it in good authority that the cattle breeders collected N6 million from the governor and assured him of the full support and collaboration of the Fulani people to the success of the law.”<br /><br />He, however, suggested a strategic national policy that would address herdsmen related issues. “It is unfair that government at all levels tried as much they could to subsidized agriculture and they forgot that cattle rearing is part of agriculture.”<br /><br />He also suggested a composition of judicial panel of inquiry that would consist of credible, apolitical and impartial members who would thoroughly investigate and unravel the people behind the “senseless” killings.<br /><br /><b>By: Fred Ezeh,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Prospects Of Biotechnology Development In Nigeria In 2018",
    "content": "<br />2017 marked an eventful year for the nation’s nascent biotechnology development. Nigeria officially signed the biosafety bill into law in 2015, making it eligible to join the league of nations that are already using biotechnology and genetic modification (GM) also called genetic engineering to boost food production and alleviate hunger. Just like any new endeavor Nigeria is trying to find a stable ground for this new technology and the Federal Government with the passage of the biosafety bill into law in line with world standard approved the establishment of a national regulatory body, the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) to oversee the safe application of biotechnology in the country.&nbsp; <br /><br />2017 in Retrospect Some striking features marked biotechnology development timeline in the nation, apart from intense sensitazation through awareness creation and raising understanding, and appreciation of modern agricultural biotechnology by stakeholders, one of the most striking was the endorsement of the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) Cotton by the Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, when he visited the Bt. Cotton trial site at the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) complex in Abuja.<br /><br />Prior to that, the agency had been having a tough time getting policy makers to support the commercialization of GM crops. The government through the NBMA also gave the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA) approval to conduct confined field trials (CFT) of genetically engineered cassava to prolong the root storage — the most nagging challenge of cassava breeders.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>The trials, which would be carried out by IITA in collaboration with several universities in Switzerland and Germany, would test cassava bred to resist deterioration using a gene-silencing technology. Another striking event of the year was the impounding and repatriation of 90 tonnes of GM maize for feed meal processing, valued at about $10 million by the NBMA in collaboration with the Nigerian Custom Service (NCS) back to Australia for illegal importation. However, giving update on the incident during a media interaction last month, the director-general of NBMA, Dr Rufus Ebegba, said the importer of the GM maize had since applied and secured approval for permit from the agency for the importation of the maize.<br /><br />According to him, “the GM maize was ordered back because there was no permit, the ship was repatriated with collaboration with Nigerian Custom Service. The applicant has applied and so far we have processed and confirmed the products to be safe.”&nbsp; &nbsp;2018 Commercialization Timeline for Bt Cotton, Bt Cowpea Still Sacrosanct The Federal Government had earlier set a timeline for the commercialization of Bt Cotton which is on general release and Bt Cowpea which its field trial commenced in 2009.<br /><br />Speaking to our correspondent, the regional head of the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Dr Issoufou Kollo Abdourhamane, and the deputy director of NABDA, Dr Rose Gidado, unanimously said Nigeria was not envisaging any delay in the commercialization of the products. According to them, the crops are going through the final stages of trials and stakeholders directly involved have already collected data and are currently developing a dossier to show the crops are safe before it is released to the public.<br /><br />They said once the dossier is presented and approved by the national varietal release committee made up of breeders and relevant stakeholders as well as the regulatory agency, NBMA, then the crops would be ready for deregulation.&nbsp; &nbsp;Update On Other GM Crops Meanwhile, other crops currently at various stages of confined field trials (CFTs) in the nation are at various stages.<br /><br />The crops include the nitrogen use efficient, water use efficient and salt tolerant (NEWEST) rice; the African Bio-fortified Sorghum (ABS); Bt maize; Herbicide tolerant soybeans and virus resistant cassava enhanced with iron and zinc. Stakeholders directly involved in the research of the projects are optimistic that the ABS and NEWEST rice have prospects of following next after the commercialization of Bt Cowpea and Bt Cotton in about three years.<br /><br />According to them the timeframe will allow researchers to complete all the necessary backcrosses to transfer the desired traits to Nigerian local varieties&nbsp; &nbsp;New Entrants The biotechnology sector is also expecting the entrance of two new genetically modified crops into its fold. They are both cassava related projects.<br /><br />The genetically modified&nbsp; cassava (AMY3 RNAi Transgenic lines) and the virus resistant cassava for Africa (VIRCA) project. The main objective of the GM cassava trial, which is currently purely for research, is to prolong root storage of cassava which is the most nagging challenge of cassava breeders. The gene construct used was developed at ETH Zurich in the laboratory of Prof. Samuel C. Zeeman. Though the Federal Government has already given approval for the CFT of the genetically modified cassava jointly sponsored by IITA and ETH- Zurich, it officially joins the biotech fold this year.<br /><br />Meanwhile the VIRCA Plus project brings cassava that carries resistance to two viral plant diseases at once to the stable: theCassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), which destroys the edible roots even when rest of the plant looks healthy, and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), which can stunt or kill plants outright.<br /><br />These two diseases are often found together in the same field and can devastate entire crops. Both diseases are spread by white-flies (which cannot be controlled with pesticides) and by infected cuttings that are unknowingly shared among farmers. Court Case Biotechnology development in Nigeria is not without its challenges. One of such challenges is a court case instituted against the NBMA by a group of non-governmental organisations before the Abuja Federal High Court over permits issued by the agency for GM cotton and maize in the country.<br /><br />The group of 17 NGOs led by the Health of Mother Earth Foundation (HOMEF) has the NBMA, the Minister of Environment, MOSANTO, NABDA, Minister of Agriculture, the Attorney General of the Federation and the National Agency for Foods Drugs and Administration (NAFDAC) as defendants in the suit. Our correspondent learnt that the suit is billed to officially kick off on January 24, 2018, when it would be officially mentioned in federal high court, Abuja.<br /><br /><b>By Nkechi Isaac</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "FG Mulls Cattle Colonies To End Farmers/Herders Clash",
    "content": "In a bid to find a permanent solution to farmers/herders clashes, the federal government is planning to set up cattle colonies across the country to assist Fulani herdsmen in rearing their cows. Apart from having adequate water and pasture for grazing of cattle, a standard cattle colony also has shopping and supply centres for diary products, with abattoirs and meat warehouses for processing finished products.<br /><br />Federal government’s decision to establish cattle colonies across the country was taken at a special security meeting with governors of five states considered as epicenters of the farmers/herders clashes and Security chiefs in Abuja yesterday.<br /><br />At the meeting, the federal government blamed the wanton killings carried out by Fulani herdsmen across the federation, especially in the middle belt on the failure of government to invest and provide necessary facilities for cow rearing. It regretted that it had not been fair to livestock farmers as it has been to other aspects of farming, saying “ this killings is due to negligence for over fifty years”.<br /><br />Acknowledging that the killings and bloodletting of hardworking farmers, if not stopped, would threaten the peace, stability and unity of the country, it promised to measure up, having realised that the abandonment and absence of government support to herders and cow rearing was largely responsible for the incessant clashes and the resultant deaths.<br /><br />Minister of Interior, General Abdulrahman Dambazau (rtd) and his Agriculture counterpart, Chief Audu Ogbe, disclosed federal government’s decision. Ogheh said, “The federal government is planning a programme called cattle colonies, not ranches but colonists, where at least 5000 hectares of land would be made available, adequate water and adequate pasture would be made available.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsYrfhPB6AU/WfBMaJlQDsI/AAAAAAAAAi4/uw7Bsj6UU78Wys2-qVEZLquG9U7ZwsnPACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cattle-Herdsmen.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsYrfhPB6AU/WfBMaJlQDsI/AAAAAAAAAi4/uw7Bsj6UU78Wys2-qVEZLquG9U7ZwsnPACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Cattle-Herdsmen.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“We also want to stop cattle from roaming the streets, farms and other areas as they will henceforth be provided with water and adequate security by the rangers, adequate pasture milk collection and even security against rustlers to enable them live normal life. This has been successfully done in India, Ethiopia and even Brazil.<br /><br />“Over the years, government has not done much to look seriously into the issue of livestock development, though people often ask why government and not herdsmen should manage their own livestock.&nbsp;<br /><br />We are sad to tell you that in the last 50 years until recently, we may have done enough for the rice farmer, the cassava farmer, the maize farmer, the cocoa farmer, but we haven’t done much for herdsmen and that inability and omission on our part is resulting in the crises we are witnessing today. “In Europe, every cow farmer gets a subsidy of 6 Euros per day.<br /><br />We have done next to nothing for the cattle rearers and as a result its operation has become a threat to the existence of our farmers. That is what this communiqué will seek to resolve”. On his part, convener of the meeting and minister of Interior said the meeting was to primarily share experiences among stakeholders and then agree on necessary measures to be taken against the menace.<br /><br />According to Dambazau, “the current situation is very dangerous to Northern Nigeria in particular and the nation in general”. The minister warned that threats to peace and public safety in any form at any location in the country will not be tolerated. He said, “It is the responsibility of government at all levels to provide, unconditionally, sustainable peace and public safety within their territorial boundaries. Against this background, the meeting is convened to primarily bring us together to share our experiences on the aforementioned security challenges.<br /><br />The meeting will then agree on necessary measures to be taken and apportion responsibilities. “The immediate repercussion of this menace includes hunger due to acute shortage of food, diseases, criminal activities and deepening animosity between ethnic and religious groups. “Knowing that general election is fast approaching and considering the history of political and election violence in Nigeria, all necessary steps must be taken to ensure that the recently witnessed crimes and violent conflicts are curtailed with utmost dispatch”.<br /><br />Governors in attendance at the meeting were those of Niger, Benue, Nasarawa and Plateau States. Others who attended the meeting include the Inspector General of Police, Commandant General of Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC), Director General of the Department of State Security Services (DSS), among others.&nbsp; <br /><br />Benue, Taraba Govs Reject Cattle Colonies Meanwhile, after a closed-door meeting that lasted for about six hours, last night, the governors of Benue and Taraba states, Samuel Ortom and Ishaku Darius rejected the proposed&nbsp; establishment&nbsp; of cattle colonies, insisting that ranching remains the best option for livestock rearing in the country They made their position known in a communiqué issued at the end of the meeting. Save Us From Annihilation, Miyetti Allah Cries Out Meanwhile, the youth wing of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) has call on the federal government to come to their aid and save the Fulani ethnic race from annihilation.<br /><br />At the end of its extra ordinary meeting in Kaduna yesterday, the association alleged that some farming communities have subjected their race to blackmail and intimidation across the country. In a statement signed by the national youth leader, Modibo Abdulkareem Bayero, the association noted that thousands of Fulani youths who rear cattle as their occupational activities have been placed on a state of uncertainty in states such as Benue, Plateau, Nasarawa, Taraba and Kaduna where their livestocks are allegedly ransacked by local farmers.<br /><br />The MACBAN youth association also urged the federal government to declare a state of emergency in Benue State where the governor has allegedly recruited private security outfits to invade Nomads’ settlement and rustle their livestock. The Association further called for the withdrawal of the open grazing prohibition law enforced by Benue and Taraba State governors. It also called for the creation of livestock ministry to cater for special attention on abundant livestock products owned by the Fulani race in Nigeria as the utmost solution to the incessant conflicts in the country.<br /><br />Benue Death Toll Rises To 71 As Ortom Declares 2-day Mourning Meanwhile, the death toll from the recent killings in Guma and Logo local government areas of Benue state by the suspected Fulani herdsmen has risen to 71. This is just as the state governor, Samuel Ortom, has declared a 2-day mourning period for those killed in the attacks, beginning from Tuesday to Wednesday this week. A statement by the chief press secretary to the governor, Mr Terver Akase, noted that the mourning period, which will end with a church service for the victims at IBB Square in Makurdi, will be followed by a burial of the deceased.<br /><br />According to him, flags will fly at half-mast within the mourning period, while work will close at 1:00pm on Tuesday and Wednesday. Thursday, which is the day for the church service and burial of the victims, is declared work-free day in the State. Meanwhile, Benue state commissioner of Agriculture, James Anbua has disclosed that the killings and destruction of farm produce in Logo and Guma local government areas will have adverse effect on food security in the state and the country at large. The commissioner, in a chat with journalists in Makurdi, condemned the Benue killings and called for the arrest of Garus Gololo who came out clearly and claimed the attacks.<br /><br />“I am calling for the arrest and prosecution of the said Gololo who came out in the media to claim the attacks on Benue citizens, with a lie that our people rustled their 1000 cattle and even attacked them when they were leaving the state”, he said.<br /><br /><b>By Christiana Nwaogu, Hembadoon Orsar&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Agriculture Created Over 6m Jobs In 2 Years – Ogbeh",
    "content": "<br />The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, said yesterday that agriculture sector created six million jobs in the last two years. Ogbeh said this while analysing the achievements of his ministry and the 2018 targets of the ministry at a strategy retreat in Abuja. The minister was reacting to reports that over four million jobs had been lost in over two years of the President Muhammadu Buhari-led federal government.<br /><br />He explained that the six million jobs were created both on and off farms as a result of the huge increase in local rice production. According to him, Nigeria’s agriculture is heavily manual and to be able to reduce rice importation by 95 per cent, at least six million extra jobs have happened in the farm. “There are about 12.2 million members of the Rice Growers Association; we have created more jobs than we have lost’’, he said.<br /><br />The minister noted that the country earned 31 million dollars from the sale of purple hibiscus popularly known as zobo leaves in the last one year and that the demand was still increasing. He said, “We are exporting more than we are importing now and most exportation is agro-products. We are growing in agriculture and from the middle of this year; whoever chooses to eat Thailand rice is welcomed to pay duties.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IVOgjLdkzJI/WdcyYkEjA7I/AAAAAAAAAQY/APCQgjPhOxYv5hh7ImwsVNa0zux3hwMBQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu%2BOgbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IVOgjLdkzJI/WdcyYkEjA7I/AAAAAAAAAQY/APCQgjPhOxYv5hh7ImwsVNa0zux3hwMBQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu%2BOgbeh.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“We shall impose duties on it because we consider it a wasteful luxury and something this country can’t afford’’. Ogbeh said the federal government would also engage in establishing both cashew and cocoa plantations to boost production and export in 2018. He said that plans are underway to make the country leading producers in cashew nuts.<br /><br />The minister said that fertiliser blending would also be improved to accommodate micronutrients in the product. Ogbeh said the government would also work to ensure quality control of produce both for export and local consumption. Committee Plans Export Of 480 Tonnes Of Yams Monthly Meanwhile, the Technical Committee on Nigeria Yam Export Programme has said it is targeting the export of about 480 tonnes of yams, equivalent to 20 containers, every month in 2018.<br /><br />Chairman of the committee, Prof. Simon Irtwange, told the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Abuja yesterday that the target would be achieved if all the challenges, which yam exporters experienced in 2017, are surmounted. Irtwange said that the U.S. had made a request for the supply of five containers monthly, which amounted to 120 tonnes of yams.<br /><br />His words: “If everything works out well, the U.S. authorities say they will need about five containers every month and one container contains 24 tonnes of yams. “We are trying to aggregate the demand from other countries; so by the time we put everything together, we should be thinking of exporting about 20 containers of yams on a monthly basis.<br /><br />“When you multiply 20 by 24, the total is 480 tonnes of yams. We have a work plan and we have a lot of activities that we have already pencilled down. We are working with relevant government agencies to provide the necessary support for the programme”.<br /><br />Irtwange further said that the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA) had made available the Ikorodu Lighter Terminal to facilitate the packaging and movement of yams meant for export. He added that the committee is also working with the NPA to get people who would invest in constructing yam pack houses at the terminal<br /><br /><b>By, Ruth Tene Natsa&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Pastoralist-Farmers Conflicts and the Search for Peaceful Resolution",
    "content": "<br /><b>Introduction</b><br />Pastoralists-farmers’ conflicts in Nigeria have grown, spread and intensified over the past decade and today poses a threat to national survival. Thousands of people have been killed, communities have been destroyed and so many farmers and pastoralists have lost their lives and property in an orgy of killings and destruction that is not only destroying livelihoods but also affecting national cohesion. Each day, we witness more reprisal killings that are simply making the possibilities of peaceful resolution more difficult. Rural banditry is becoming the norm in the Nigerian hinterland and has been transformed into a vicious criminal activity. The result is that the scale of loss of both herds and human life has been escalating and the victims are on all sides – subsistence farmers, commercial farmers and pastoralists. Nonetheless, we write this memo to say we cannot give up to hate and destruction, let’s pause, reflect and seek a way out of the crisis.<br /><br />Nigeria has a large pastoral population the logic of whose livelihood is often misunderstood. What is better understood is the culture of farming, which is rooted in a specific location and has activities that take place regularly. The assumption that pastoralism is in itself an irrational production system is far from the truth. Pastoralism is the main livestock production system in much of Africa where pastoralists live in semi arid zones. It is a historically developed strategy to cope with the uncertainties associated with climate change, build up of parasites and other related challenges. It is above all an efficient way to produce livestock at relatively low prices through the use of non-commercial feeding stock. Historically, pastoralists have been able to meet the meat demand in West Africa with a relatively high level of efficiency without government subsidy for generations.<br />Different methods through the use of farm residue and open range grazing have allowed this trend to flourish. Nigeria has a landmass of 98.3 million hectares, 82 million hectares of arable land of which about 34 million hectares are currently under cultivation. In crop farming, human beings only directly utilize about a quarter of the total biomass. The other three quarters is in the form of crop residue and low quality crop, which is not directly useful to people. It is this residue that cattle (ruminants) convert into meat and milk. In addition to this, cattle also utilize grasses on fallow lands, non-arable poor quality lands, open ranges and fadama in the same manner. Pastoralists move their animals to these locations to access these opportunities. This system of production is breaking down today as violent conflicts between pastoralists and farmers have arisen and created a major national crisis.<br /><br /><b>The Problem</b><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVStvEaCN90/WlR9RZnLkcI/AAAAAAAAA-0/RLR61jefIiwZIlHB4cuUWk6xGrfCe1TuACLcBGAs/s1600/Pastorialist-%2BFarmers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"371\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eVStvEaCN90/WlR9RZnLkcI/AAAAAAAAA-0/RLR61jefIiwZIlHB4cuUWk6xGrfCe1TuACLcBGAs/s320/Pastorialist-%2BFarmers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Nigeria’s population has grown from 33 million in 1950 to about 192.3 million today. The United Nations recently projected more growth in terms of population in the coming years, 364 million in 2030 and 480 million in 2050 respectively. This phenomenal increase of the population has put enormous pressure on land and water resources used by farmers and pastoralists. Specifically, the demographic increase has led to an expansion in cultivated farmland and a reduction in available grazing land for pastoralists that is characterised by competition over dwindling resources. In the far north, the impact of desertification as well as the crisis of energy, which has resulted in deforestation, coupled with climatic uncertainty and lower rainfall have made it more difficult to sustain increasing populations, pushing many farmers and pastoralists with livestock southwards. This has happened gradually over a period of decades – with an apparent increase over the past decade – and has added to pressure on land and water in central and southern Nigeria.<br /><br />One of the outcomes of this process has been the blockage of transhumance routes and loss of grazing land to agricultural expansion and the increased southward movement of pastoralists has led to increased conflict with local communities. This is particularly the case in the Middle Belt – notably in Plateau, Kaduna, Niger, Nasarawa, Benue, Taraba, and Adamawa States. The conflicts often have localised dynamics, but primarily involve Fulani pastoralists and local farming communities.<br />The Nigerian state has a relatively weak rural presence and has neglected the agrarian sector since the 1970s, when oil revenues began to dominate the economy. There have been few improvements in agricultural productivity and livestock production as a result of the dependence on oil revenues, which have not been reinvested in productive economic activities. State response in the context of the lingering conflicts between farmers and pastoralists has been both ad hoc and reactive, with no concrete and sustainable strategies for conflict management and peace building beyond the deployment of security or establishment of commissions of inquiries. One of the key pathways here is for the state to be more proactive in its responses by putting in place mechanisms that are institutionalised and sustainable both at the local and state levels.<br /><br />As violence between herdsmen and farmers has grown and developed into criminality and rural banditry, popular narratives creating meaning, context and (mis) understandings have been emerging. The narratives emerging on rural banditry in the media and in popular discourse are becoming part of the drivers for expanding conflicts in the country. The protagonists in this saga are often presented as being nomadic Fulani cattle herders, who are mostly Muslims, and sedentary farmer communities of several other ethnic extractions, who are often, but not always non-Muslims. These two distinct groups are usually depicted as perpetrators and victims, respectively. Perspectives of the social, religious and ethnic characteristics of these rural communities are framed into expansive essentialist discourses that actively breed and sustain suspicion and distrust. The result is negative stereotyping between “the one” and “the other” that lead further to ethnic and religious bigotry which fuels the hate process, culminating in further chains of attacks and counter or revenge attacks being exchanged between these different groups. Nigeria urgently needs to find pathways to get out of the crisis and one approach may be the development of grazing reserves for pastoralists.<br /><br /><b>Grazing Reserves As Possible Solution&nbsp;</b><br />It is clear that Nigeria and indeed Africa have to plan towards the transformation of pastoralism into settled forms of animal husbandry. The establishment of grazing reserves provides the opportunity for practicing a more limited form of pastoralism and is therefore a pathway towards a more settled form of animal husbandry. Grazing reserves are areas of land demarcated, set aside and reserved for exclusive or semi-exclusive use by pastoralists. Currently, Nigeria has a total of 417 grazing reserves all over the country, out of which only about 113 have been gazetted. There are many problems facing the implementation of the provisions of the 1965 Grazing Reserve Law and the management of the established grazing reserves. First, most of the grazing reserves were established by the then Northern Regional Government. Since the 1970’s subsequent military and civilian governments have in effect abandoned the policy of establishing and developing grazing reserves. Secondly, State governments have not been diligent in sustaining previous policies and have not surveyed and gazetted most of the designated grazing reserves. Indeed, only 113 (about 27%) of the 417 proposed grazing reserves have been gazetted.<br /><br />Whether we support or oppose pastoralism, it is clear that at least in the short and medium term, many herds must continue to practice seasonal migration between dry and wet season grazing areas, incorporating past harvest grazing farmland in the highly developed and ecologically sound pattern of transhumance evolved by the pastoralist over the centuries. This is an important point to make at this point when many political actors think it is possible to simply and abruptly ban open grazing. There is indeed, the need for permanent settlement of pastoralists both in the far north and semi humid zone of the middle belt. It is important to focus on the development of grazing reserves as part of the solution.<br /><br /><b>The Law, Politics and Pastoralism</b><br />One of the greatest difficulties in addressing and resolving issues surrounding pastoralism is the politicisation of legal regimes and the blockages to the enactment of or implementation of laws that can redress the key challenges posed. In 2016 for example, a bill was proposed - ‘‘A Bill for an Act to establish Grazing Reserve in each of the states of the Federation Nigeria to improve agriculture yield from livestock farming and curb incessant conflicts between cattle farmers and crop farmers in Nigeria.’’ The National Assembly on the basis that the Bill appeared to be seeking to favour one particular profession carried out by mainly one ethnic group, the Fulani, threw it out. The problem is that if we cannot have grazing reserves and if pastoralists cannot move, how do we expect the 19 million cattle grazing in the country to survive and how do we protect our Constitutional principle of free movement.<br /><br /><b>Free Movement and Restrictions to Transhumance</b><br />There is an emerging conflict between the constitutional principle on free movement of persons and goods and laws emerging in some States restricting movement. In Section 41(1) of the Nigerian Constitution, it is stated that:<br />&nbsp;‘‘Every citizen of Nigeria is entitled to move freely throughout Nigeria and to reside in any part thereof, and no citizen of Nigeria shall be expelled from Nigeria or refused entry thereby or exit therefrom.’’<br />Some States have enacted laws or are processing bills to prevent open grazing on their territory.<br /><br />There are four initiatives so far:<br />1. Ekiti State: Prohibition of Cattle and Other Ruminants Grazing in Ekiti, 2016.<br />2. Taraba State: Anti-Open Grazing Prohibition and Ranches Establishment Bill 2017. ‘A bill for a law to prohibit open rearing and grazing of livestock and provide for the establishment of ranches and the Taraba State livestock and ranches administration and control committee and for others connected thereto 2017’.<br />3. Edo State Bill: A Bill for A Law to Establish the Edo State Control of Nomadic Cattle Rearing/Grazing Law and for Other Purposes.<br />4. Benue State Law: A Law to Prohibit Open Rearing and Grazing of Livestock and Provide for the Establishment of Ranches and Livestock Administration, Regulation and Control and for Other Matters Connected Therewith, 2017.<br /><br />It is worthwhile posing the question whether laws can be effective in prohibiting pastoralism, which is practiced by millions of Nigerians. As some of the laws have already been passed, they would have to be tested in court. It is important to stress however that the Constitution guarantees free movement of persons and goods across Nigeria and no State government can withdraw constitutionally entrenched rights. Secondly, following a legislation by the Ogun State Government and the Supreme Court Judgment on the matter cited as “A.G. OGUN STATE V. ALHAJA AYINKE ABERUAGBA (1985) 1 NWLR PG. 395” States were barred from interfering with inter-state commerce and the free movement of goods and services. At that time, Ogun State had tried to control and tax goods entering from other States and the Supreme Court ruled that it would be chaotic if States enacted any laws they please restricting movement of goods and services in the Federation. It was this judgment that led to the introduction of value added tax (VAT) as a State tax that is determined at the national level and collected by the Federal Government, which takes an administrative fee and redistributes the proceeds back to the States. The key issue however is that pastoralism has developed into a national crisis that is leading to increased violence so a legal approach alone cannot resolve the issue. It is therefore important to negotiate a national policy framework that would protect the interests of both farmers and herders. The Federal Government should take the initiative of negotiating a consensual policy framework that would address the issues.<br /><br /><b>Developing a Comprehensive Policy Framework</b><br />Livestock production in Nigeria is in existential crisis and the country lacks a cohesive and comprehensive policy framework for livestock development and regulation in Nigeria. The defunct Northern Grazing Reserve Law has not been updated, the Land Use Act of 1978 is dysfunctional, emerging state grazing reserve laws, the ECOWAS Transhumance Protocol and other related international instruments have to be updated and streamlined.<br /><br /><b>Recommendation</b><br />Piecemeal of sectorial approach to livestock development will not suffice. A new policy framework should be developed that is both comprehensive and must be mutually beneficial to pastoralists and farmers. Any policy that does not take into consideration the welfare of both sides will most likely fail or meet resistance by either side. An inter-ministerial committee should be constituted with experts and stakeholder membership to draw up the framework. There must be a consultative process that listens to the concerns of all stakeholders in developing the new framework so that the outcome would have national ownership.<br /><br /><b>The Future of Pastoralism and Animal Husbandry</b><br />Pastoralism is not sustainable in Nigeria over the long term due to high population growth rate, expansion of farming and loss of pasture and cattle routes. At the same time, pastoralism cannot be prohibited in the short term as there are strong cultural and political economy reasons for its existence. It is important therefore to develop a plan for a transitional period during which new systems would be put in place.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />Experts should be assembled to map out the duration, strategy and timelines for the transition plan. As there is no miracle model for solving the problems, the plan should simultaneously pursue a number of models including:<br />i. Ranching can be pursued as one of the possible models in areas with lower population densities in the North East (Sambisa Game Reserve in Borno State) and North West (Gidan Jaja Grazing Reserve in Zamfara State);<br />ii. Semi-intensive systems of animal husbandry should be pursued accompanied with requisite investment in infrastructure, training, extension, marketing and animal health service delivery in conjuncture with the private sector;<br />iii. The traditional form of pastoralism should continue for a period to be agreed upon with some improvements (in the form of coordinated mobility between wet and dry season grazing areas and effective management of farmers and pastoralists relations);<br />iv. Use of and development of grazing reserves to target pastoralists with large stocks where skills for pasture production, large milk production, etc can be promoted.<br />v. Development of integrated crop-livestock systems with farmers and pastoralists being encouraged to keep some animals in their farms.<br />vi. In order to meet the feeding needs of herds, alternative low water and drought resistant grasses should be produced, in response to the impact of desertification on fodder production.<br /><br /><b>Modernisation of Livestock</b><br />Nigeria has one of the lowest productivity levels of livestock in the world. It is for this reason that Nigeria imports very large quantities of milk, fish and chicken. The Nigerian herd requires sustained efforts at quality development based on a modernisation strategy that would transform the industry and move the country towards the objective of self-reliance.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />The programme for the country’s transition to modern forms of animal husbandry must be accelerated and funded. The national stock would require rapid improvement and modernisation to meet market demands for meat, milk, hides and other products from the industry:<br />i. Commercial ranches should be established in some of the sparsely populated zones in the North East and North West;<br />ii. The business community should be encouraged through policy measures to invest in the establishment of modern dairy farms;<br />iii. Sensitisation programmes should be undertaken on the values of livestock improvement and breeding centres for the production of quality heifers to improve pastoral stock should be developed all over the country.<br />iv. Efforts should be made towards modelling best practices of pastoral-farmer relations as evident in countries such as Chad, Ethiopia and Niger, where the existence of institutionalised and functional mechanisms for pre-empting and resolving conflicts between farmers and pastoralists enable them to live in peace.<br /><br /><b>Growing Conflicts and Imperative of Peace Building</b><br />Over the past decade, there has been a dramatic explosion of violent conflicts associated with the deteriorating relationship between farmers and herders, cattle rustling and rural banditry in Nigeria. There is also limited knowledge about who the perpetrators are and their motives.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />A comprehensive approach to necessary to address the growing crisis associated with violence affecting pastoralism and farmers in Nigeria. The Federal Government should commission a large-scale research endeavour to carry out in-depth study to understand the reasons for the escalation of violence, key actors, motivations and agency fuelling the crisis.<br /><br /><b>The Boko Haram Insurgency</b><br />Specific measures are required to address the Boko Haram insurgency North Eastern States of Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Taraba and Yobe, which have close to 40% of the total cattle, sheep and goats of the National herd. These States also have the highest number of grazing reserves 255 or 61% of the 415 nationally identified grazing reserves. There are also many kilometres of stock routes interconnecting these reserves. The highest number of transhumance and trade cattle, sheep and goats from ECOWAS countries, Chad, Cameroun, Central African Republic and other countries, come into Nigeria on North Eastern International Transhumance Route.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />In addition to the search for improving security in the zone through the use of security forces and mobilizing the civil population, some policy decisions are required. The military should be encouraged to pursue the path of ranching as it has already decided to. The Sambisa Grazing Reserve (4800 ha) is an ideal and symbolic place to take-off by establishing a ranch run by the military. It would significantly improve the security situation in the zone and encourage cooperation between pastoralists and the military. In the North West, the military should also be encouraged to create ranches in the Gidan Jaja Grazing Reserve (565,000 ha) for the same purpose of improving security and cooperation with pastoralists.<br /><br /><b>Growth of Hate and Dangerous Speech</b><br />Hate speech has now become a generator and accelerator of violent conflicts and the phenomenon of fake news is worsening its negative impact.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Recommendations</b><br />There is need for the development of a media code to be used in sensitizing the media on the relevant international standards on reporting issues of conflict and banditry. This process should involve conflict sensitivity and safety training and it should be based on very strict journalistic standards. Appropriate laws and regulations should be developed at both the federal and state levels towards ensuring that the margin of what is seen, as “free speech” in the media will be effectively regulated.&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>Breakdown of Traditional Conflict Resolution Mechanisms</b><br />One of the most important dimensions of the growing conflicts between pastoralists and farmers has been the breakdown of traditional conflict resolution mechanisms. In the past, when conflicts arise, they were settles by village heads and ardos, Fulani community leaders and if the need for payment of compensation arises, there were traditional systems and knowledge of how to assess damage done and the amount necessary to compensate for the damage and not profiteering. What we see today as a breakdown of traditional authority in the context of conflict management is a consequence of the take over of their powers by the state at the federal, state and local government levels, through the ad hoc measures that are often time wasting and whose recommendations are not implemented.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />Cattle routes should be restored and significant investment made in restoring traditional conflict resolution mechanisms. As massive corruption has accompanied the increased presence of the police and courts in matters affecting farmers and herders, there should be advocacy and administrative guidance to return to traditional methods of conflict resolution. There should be capacity development of farmers and herders associations so that they play a more positive role in the process.<br /><br /><b>The Environmental and Climate Smart Pastoralism</b><br />Livestock produce some greenhouse emissions and pollutants. These can however be mitigated and even reversed by the sustainability of the methods that are used. On the whole, pastoralism is the only renewable non-extractive use of Ryland resources and it plays an essential role in maintaining soil and water quality. In addition, it slows down the loss of biodiversity.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />Intensive capacity building is required in promoting and advocating for climate smart approaches to animal husbandry including the prevention of overgrazing, promoting integration of grazing and manure provision for farms and coordinated movement between ecological zones in the dry and wet seasons.<br /><br /><b>Legislative Solutions</b><br />There are discordant laws and regulations that legislate livestock production and pastoralism at the regional, national and state levels. Some of the newly emerging laws such as the “anti-grazing” state laws appear to contradict the free movement principle enshrined in the Constitution.<br /><br /><b>Recommendations</b><br />i. A harmonization of relevant laws and policies that governs grazing reserves. Specifically, the 1965 Grazing Reserve Law can be revived based on section 315 of the 1999 constitution in the 19 northern states.<br />ii. This should be complemented with a national review and protection of traditional stock routes;<br />iii. Regional instruments governing pastoralism should be protected and above all domesticated;<br />iv. In addition to the laws, consultative process between farming and pastoral communities are required to review the effect of statutes and regulations on routine practices of animal husbandry.<br /><br /><b>Expanding Grazing Reserves</b><br />The Nigerian livestock industry is largely dependent on natural vegetation. Although there is a vast hectrage of natural vegetation in the country they are not maximally utilized due to poor planning and conflicting government policies. It was estimated that there are over 40 million hectares of grazing land in Nigeria, out of which only 3 million hectares are specifically tagged as grazing reserves.<br />Recommendations<br />The idea to encourage nomads to settle was first made in 1942 but never implemented. A clear policy of land grant to pastoralists should be developed and implemented by state governments.<br /><br /><b>Digital Tracking of Cattle&nbsp;</b><br />The Katsina State Government has just launched a digital tracking system for cattle in the State. It involves inserting microchips in the animals skin and tracking them with mobile phones. The use of such technologies could help address the problem of cattle rustling and violence that have become so rampant. Such initiatives should be supported.<br /><br /><b>The Construction of Positive Narratives</b><br />The atmosphere between farming and pastoral communities is extremely bitter and negative. Support should be provided for creative writers in Nollywood, Kannywood, radio and television to create new narratives showing how the interaction between the two groups could be peaceful and mutually beneficial. Above all, the National Orientation Agency (NOA), as an institution with presence across the 774 Local Government Areas (LGAs) of the country, should provide these critical services.<br /><br />Being a Memorandum by the Nigerian Working Group on Peace Building and Governance<br />Abuja, 8th January 2018<br /><br /><b>Signed by:</b><br /><b>Professor Ibrahim Gambari</b><br /><b>General Martin Luther Agwai (Rtd)</b><br /><b>Professor Jibrin Ibrahim</b><br /><b>Professor Attahiru Jega</b><br /><b>Dr. Chris Kwaja</b><br /><b>Ambassador Fatima Balla</b><br /><b>Dr. Nguyan Fesse</b><br /><b>Mrs. Aisha Muhammed-Oyebode</b><br /><b>Mallam Y.

    "title": "Scientists Project Good Harvest This Year, as Plans to Release BT Cotton, Cowpea, Others Gain Support",
    "content": "<br />&nbsp;Scientists in Nigeria have said that plans to release BT cotton, Pod Borer Resistant (PBR) Cowpea, Genetically Modified Cassava and other crops have been given green light, as Confined Field Trial for these crops have been conducted successfully.<br /><br />The scientists also said that the formal release of these crops to farmers will commence after approvals from the National Biosafety Management Agency and the Varietal Release Committee were given.<br /><br />During an interactive chat with the Country Coordinator of Open Forum on Agriculture Biotechnology (OFAB), Dr Rose Gidado, she said the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, during a visit to the trial site of BT cotton in Abuja, pledged support for the crop in order to be used to revive the textile industry.<br /><br />During the visit, Chief Ogbeh said “I am happy with what I have seen today, stakeholders can talk about Bt-Cotton in the country now. You can yell loud about Bt-Cotton now.&nbsp; Farmers keep talking about good seeds, they mostly lament that when cotton starts growing, it then literally vanishes.<br /><br />“We need to cut down importation and increase export, our country is coming out of recession but there are serious challenges coming up. Our economy is growing at the rate of 3.2 per cent the economy needs to perform at 6.7 per cent, otherwise we cannot say there is growth.&nbsp; In the next 3-4years, our population will be 200 million and 450million by 2050, this is scary, so what we are doing now is little compared to what we need to do”.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o4nl1MxJ-js/WlRugOyMNJI/AAAAAAAAA-k/4qqjIJHHwoYf3v_OLvjkesojNwtTqLefgCLcBGAs/s1600/Dr-Rose-Gidado-coordinator-OFAB-and-Dr-Issoufou-Abdourhamane-Regional-Head-AATF.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-o4nl1MxJ-js/WlRugOyMNJI/AAAAAAAAA-k/4qqjIJHHwoYf3v_OLvjkesojNwtTqLefgCLcBGAs/s320/Dr-Rose-Gidado-coordinator-OFAB-and-Dr-Issoufou-Abdourhamane-Regional-Head-AATF.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Gidado, however said “We had support on BT cotton deployment and domestication in the country. The support came from the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh when he visited the BT Cotton evaluation trial we are carrying out here in Abuja.<br /><br />“He saw the difference between the BT cotton and the conventional cotton all planted side by side, there was no pollution of the environment and he saw the number of balls on the BT cotton and he saw the vigor in the BT cotton and as well as the low performance of our Nigerian cotton variety in terms of number if balls and infestation because it was really infested with the Pink Ball Worm.<br /><br />“The BT cotton was not infested because it was developed to resist the ball worm, so we saw the efficacy of the gene of insert, the Minister saw it, made a statement of endorsement and he said he will work with us to revamp the textile industry because he saw the need to use the BT cotton to the revamp the textile industry”.<br /><br />Furthermore, she said some farmers have abandoned cotton cultivation because the crop’s susceptibility to the ball worm and other insects. Cotton is susceptible to many insect attack, but the ball worm is the most ravaging and you have to do about 10 sprays of chemicals for you to have something meaningful, it really discouraged the farmers and the breeders.<br /><br />“But with this technology, the farmers can now go back to cotton cultivation and the textile industries can be revamped and resuscitate, at least that will create jobs, wealth and the economy will be revived”.<br /><br />It will be recalled that in the early 60s to mid 70s, the textile industry was the second largest employer of labour in Nigeria but because of these problems, everything went down and textile materials are very expensive now because Nigeria imports textile products.<br /><br />“The BT cotton Evaluation Trial started in 2016 and it is actually to confirm the efficacy of the gene of insert and the safety of the gene of insert and also to generate regulatory data and generate data for the Varietal Release Committee, so I think they have done that, and it is actually two years that these things are suppose to happen.<br /><br />“So, I think by the end of February, they should have enough data to submit to the Varietal Release Committee and also to submit to National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA) and that will determine the next step to take.<br /><br />“The trials were not only conducted in the research institutes but also on the farmers field and that is one of the requirements of the Varietal Release Committee that farmers will try the crops on their farms and be satisfied and at the end certify that it is working well.<br /><br />“The trial was conducted in 10 states, and the number of chemical sprays has been reduced to just two which is basically aimed at controlling non-target insects which are insects outside the family of Ball worm”, Dr Gidado added.<br /><br />Also, the African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF), Regional Head, West Africa, Dr Issoufou Abdourhamane said in Nigeria, they have two projects on biotechnology.<br /><br />The first according to him is the Pod Borer Resistant Cowpea, and the second one is the Nitrogen-Use Efficient, Water-Use Efficient and Salt Tolerant Rice (NEWEST) rice project.<br /><br />“Because we want to do a rice variety which can use very efficiently nitrogen of the soil under rainfall condition not under irrigation because most of the rice in Nigeria is produced under rainfall, you know when it rains in Nigeria, most of the time it rains a lot, so in this tropical environment, what happens is that all the nutrients are mixed, the plants have very few nitrogen no matter how farmers apply it.<br /><br />“So we want a variety we can use that small remaining quantity nitrogen, very efficient, efficiency here means for every quantity nitrogen taken up by the plant, it produces more rice than the local variety. So this project is going well in Badegi at the cereal research centre.<br /><br />“For PBR Cowpea, we have conducted the last experimental trials, so we want this cowpea to be out this year, to be tested by farmers on large scale, we were able to get a handful of farmers in a confined environment to test the cowpea and they are through with it. We are almost done with the essential trials, it is highly advanced, we will go on large scale production this year.<br /><br />“We have to develop a dossier to show that the PBR Cowpea is safe for human consumption only after approval by the National Biosafety Management Agency, then we go on large under moderate drought” Dr Abdourhamane added.<br /><br />For Water Efficient Maize for Africa ( WEMA) which has been proven to withstand the attacks from ArmyWorm, Dr Abdourhamane said “we want Nigeria to be part of WEMA project, we have some maize varieties that can withstand the attack of Armyworm. We really want Nigeria to be part of it, it is a very big project for us, we are waiting for the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the Agriculture Research Council of Nigeria just to give us green light.<br /><br />“And WEMA will also have support from the African Development Bank to get more countries involved especially Nigeria, if you don’t solve Nigeria’s food problem, forget about the rest of West Africa because it is 80 per cent of West Africa”.<br /><br />According to the developer of the WEMA, project, Dr Sylvester Oikeh, “the WEMA product (varieties) should be able to give us a yield advantage of between 20-35 per cent over the yield of the commercialised varieties that were in the market in 2008 when the project started.<br /><br />“Under moderate drought, the WEMA product (varieties) should be able to give us a yield advantage of between 20-35 per cent over the yield of the commercialised varieties that were in the market in 2008 when the project started.<br /><br />“For WEMA, we are using conventional breeding, we are using Genetically Modified (GM), for the conventional products, it is the drought tolerant materials. To develop drought tolerant maize took a very long number of years, in fact, scientists will tell you that every year, they can increase by 1-1.5 per cent advantage, so it means to develop material and come out with drought tolerant of&nbsp; about 25 per cent, you need almost 10 year. So we said we want to develop this product, half conventional and then we insert the gene which confers some level of drought tolerance to it maybe 8-10 per cent.<br /><br />“For the transgenic which is the GM product, it requires some regulations, it requires approval before it can get to the farmers, but the conventional is in 5 WEMA Countries which include Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Mozambique and South Africa, they have approved more than 90 of the conventional, some of them are already in the hands of the farmers particularly in Kenya and the farmers are benefiting enormously from the product.<br /><br />On Cassava, Dr Gidado said “we are expecting commencement of trial for VIRCA (Virus Resistant Cassava) Plus Cassava project which is for disease resistance and its nutritionally enhanced with iron and zinc, the project is already ongoing in Uganda and Kenya and Nigeria is going to be the third country. We are expecting he commencement of the trial by June”<br /><br />VIRCA Plus is developing cassava that carries resistance to two viral plant diseases at once: Cassava Brown Streak Disease (CBSD), which destroys the edible roots even when rest of the plant looks healthy, and Cassava Mosaic Disease (CMD), which can stunt or kill plants outright. These two diseases are often found together in the same field and can devastate entire crops. Both diseases are spread by white-flies (which cannot be controlled with pesticides) and by infected cuttings that are unknowingly shared among farmers.<br /><br />CMD has been damaging farmers’ fields across Africa for decades.<br /><br />Over the last 15 years, CBSD has spread rapidly and now affects cassava production across East and Central Africa. It threatens to move into West Africa where it would impact cassava production in Nigeria, the continent’s largest cassava producing country, with its largest population.<br /><br />VIRCA Plus is also developing cassava that has elevated levels of both iron and zinc for improved nutrition, as well as resistance to cassava disease. The BioCassava Plus project (2005-2016) succeeded in developing and testing cassava plants that accumulated greater than 10 times more iron and zinc than comparable varieties, using the tools of modern biotechnology.<br /><br />Field trials have shown that cassava roots could possibly provide 40-70% of the Estimated Average Requirement of these minerals for vulnerable women and children after processing into common African foodstuffs, such as gari and fufu.<br /><br />The primary source of dietary iron and zinc for rural and urban resource poor is obtained through consumption of plant foods, especially legumes and leafy vegetables and whole grain cereals.<br /><br />However, access to the required quantity and quality of these foods of often seasonal and not assured. Cassava roots are an excellent low cost source of starch year round, but they contain a fraction of the iron and zinc required in a healthy diet.&nbsp; Nutritionally enhanced VIRCA Plus cassava varieties could help reduce micronutrient malnutrition.<br /><br />Iron deficiency anemia compromises the immune system, stunts growth and impairs cognitive development in children, while deficiency in zinc causes increased risk of death from diarrhea, stunting and reduced cognitive development.<br /><br />In Nigeria alone, 75 per cent of preschool children and 67 per cent of pregnant women are anemic (WHO 2008) and across sub-Saharan Africa an estimated 24 per cent of the population are at risk from zinc deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake (Prasad, 2012).<br /><br />It is important that the Nigerian government rise up to the challenge of making Nigeria food sufficient through the adoption of biotechnology as a modern tool to increase crop yield and ease the stress of farming.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Chidera</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Governor Willie Obiano has warned herdsmen who carry dangerous weapons about to desist from such act or face the full wrath of the law in Anambra State.<br />He gave the warning yesterday at a reception organised in his honour by Aguleri people.The governor assured the residents that herdsmen/farmers’ crisis which had ravaged parts of the state was under control, with a pledge to find a lasting solution to the problem.He, however, directed that herdsmen, wielding AK-47 rifles and other dangerous weapons, should not be allowed in the state.<br /><br />According to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN), Obiano was quoted as saying that his government had commenced actions to forestall any incident that may lead to mayhem or loss of lives.“Part of the measures taken to address the menace was sensitising both the host communities and the herdsmen of the existing agreement.”<br /><br />However, the Ondo government says it would not prohibit cattle rearing in the state. It, however, stated that plans were underway to regulate the activities of herdsmen to ensure peaceful co-existence.<br /><br />The Senior Special Assistant to the Governor on Agriculture, Akin Olotu, at a stakeholders’ meeting yesterday affirmed that the government had no plan to neither ban grazing nor restrict anyone from farming.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YsaVfygXaJA/WlRtV5cbE8I/AAAAAAAAA-c/eq72902OlHgnrbGzR1kT6p_Q9RTAm5yLgCLcBGAs/s1600/Obiano-Condemns-killing1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-YsaVfygXaJA/WlRtV5cbE8I/AAAAAAAAA-c/eq72902OlHgnrbGzR1kT6p_Q9RTAm5yLgCLcBGAs/s320/Obiano-Condemns-killing1.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />According to him, the meeting became necessary to find a lasting solution to the ceaseless crises between the herdsmen and farmers which had assumed an alarming dimension across the state in the last couple of weeks.<br /><br />“We are not going to prohibit cattle rearing in Ondo State. We are going to regulate it. It is not a crime to rear or own cattle in any part of the state, but it has to be done legitimately.<br /><br />“It has to be done in such a way that someone’s business is not used to destroy another person’s. So what we have in Ondo State is cattle regulation in which case there will be dos and don’ts,” he said.<br /><br />Olotu urged the people to be ambassadors of peace and adopt the ‘know your neighbours’ strategy.He added that the early warning mechanism in communities had been effective, describing the responses as encouraging.<br /><br />The stakeholders, comprising security agencies, settlers, herdsmen, farmers, officials of the Ministry of Agriculture, traditional as well as community leaders, lauded security operatives for their prompt action in maintaining peace in the land.<br /><br />They noted that the destruction of farmlands by the herdsmen and their cattle remained a great threat to food security, saying many farmers who obtained loans from banks had been plunged into indebtedness due to the development.<br /><br />The stakeholders sought for a way to identify erring herdsmen. They also agreed that an inclusive committee should be put in place in all of the state’s 18 local councils to check the menace. It was equally resolved that there should be sustained sensitisation on peaceful co-existence among the herdsmen, Hausa and farmers in the state.<br /><br /><b>By Oluwaseun Akingboye,</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

It is the responsibility of governments at all levels to provide, unconditionally, sustainable peace and public safety within their territorial boundaries.<br /><br />“Against this background, the meeting is convened to primarily bring us together to share our experiences on the aforementioned security challenges.<br />“The meeting will then agree on the necessary measures to be taken and apportion responsibilities.<br />“The immediate repercussions of this menace include hunger due to the acute shortage of food, diseases, criminal activities and deepening animosity between ethnic and religious groups.<br />“The current situation is very dangerous for the Northern part of the country in particular and the country in general,” the interior minister said.<br /><br />Also speaking, Ogbeh conceded that the federal government had not done enough to cater for the needs of the herdsmen.<br />In recent years, herdsmen have been migrating to the Middle Belt and Southern Nigeria due to the effects of climate change and the attendant desert encroachment on grazing lands in the North.<br /><br />But in the process, sedentary farmers have complained that they are losing their crops to uncontrolled livestock grazing, often resulting in cattle rustling and violent altercations between them and the herders.<br /><br />According to Ogheh, “The farmer and herdsmen must not have their lives threatened by circumstances surrounding their professions. We do not want the farmer to lose his crops, nor would we want anyone to lose their cattle.<br /><br />“Over the years, we have not done much to look seriously into the issue of livestock development in the country. People ask the question why should the government get involved? Why shouldn’t the herdsmen manage their own livestock?<br /><br />“I am sad to tell you that in the last 50 years, until recently, we may have done enough for the rice farmer, the cassava farmer, the maize farmer, the cocoa farmer, but we haven’t done much for herdsmen and that inability and omission on our part is resulting in the crises we are witnessing today.<br /><br />“In Europe, every cow that is farmed gets a subsidy of six euros per day; we have done next to nothing for the cattle rearers here and as a result, their operations have become a threat to the existence of our farmers and that is what this meeting will seek to resolve.”<br />He said the federal government was planning cattle colonies where adequate water and pastures would be made available to herders in the country.<br /><br />“We are planning a programme called cattle colonies, not ranches, but colonies where at least 5, 000 hectares of land would be made available, adequate water and pastures would be made available.<br />“We also want to stop cattle rearers from roaming about; the culture of cattle roaming will be stopped.<br />“The cattle will be provided with water and adequate security by the rangers, there will be adequate pasture milk collection, and even security against rustlers to enable them to lead a normal life.<br /><br />“This has been done elsewhere in India, Ethiopia and even Brazil,” Ogbeh explained.<br />The agriculture minister went further to express reservations against the open grazing culture, noting that the culture should be reformed as it had become harmful to the people.<br />“Many will argue that open grazing is part of our culture, but once a culture is becoming a threat to people, leading to deaths, it must be dropped,” Ogbeh said.<br /><br />He maintained that cattle ranching and not the traditional system of migration by herdsmen would provide a final solution to the needless bloodletting.<br />The minister also said artificial insemination and the provision of special grass for cattle will lead to improved yields.<br /><br />After the meeting, which lasted for about seven hours, the Benue State Governor, Mr. Ortom, told reporters who had been waiting for the meeting’s outcome that there was no need to politicise the matter of the herdsmen killings and Nigerians should be discouraged from hate speech.<br /><br />He said part of the modalities put in place was the deployment of more security personnel to the affected and troubled spots, more logistics and helicopters to conduct surveillance.<br />Ortom said all herdsmen and their livestock were welcome in Benue but the animals must be ranched.<br />“All herdsmen and cattle breeders are allowed in Benue but you must ranch them. If we see any animal roaming about, we will know they are rustlers,” he said.<br /><br />His Taraba State counterpart, Mr. Ishaku, concurred stating that ranching was possible, as it had successfully been done in other countries.<br />He further added that Nigerians must be enlightened on the need and importance of peaceful co-existence.<br /><br />Another Three Killed in Taraba<br /><br />But just as Ishaku was attending the meeting in Abuja, the police in his state confirmed the death of three persons, while no fewer than six others sustained injuries in another overnight attack on Maisamari town in Sardauna Local Government Area of the state by a suspected militia group.<br />Monday’s attack occurred a few days after some 24 persons were killed in attacks on three Taraba communities. The earlier attacks occurred in a separate local government, Lau.<br /><br />The police spokesperson in the state, Mr. David Misal, who confirmed the latest incident to the News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Jalingo, said the incident took place during a cultural event called Nding-Chin.<br />The cultural event was said to have been held in the area for the first time.<br />Misal, who said the area was now calm, disclosed that the command had deployed additional police officers to beef up security.<br /><br />Also speaking on the incident, the acting chairman of Sardauna Local Government Council, Mr. Godwin Sol, said that the state government had previously banned all cultural meetings and festivals because of the security situation in the area.<br /><br />He said he was surprised to learn that a group, which mobilised its kinsmen from surrounding villages, had held a dance event in Maisamari against the council’s order.<br />He said security operatives were later mobilised to disperse the gathering, adding that due to the size of the crowd, a time frame within which to complete the exercise and disperse them was given.<br /><br />Sol said at the expiration of the time frame, instead of leaving the town as agreed, the group relocated to the house of one Yaya Ahmadun to continue with the dance which continued into the night.<br /><br />“It was while this was on going that some unknown gunmen attacked the place and killed three persons and injured six others,” he said.<br />The council boss said the host of the event in Maisamari, as well as leaders of the cultural group, were arrested.<br />It was also learnt that the injured were taken to the Gembu General Hospital for treatment.<br /><br /><b>By: Olawale Ajimotokan and Kuni Tyessi in Abuja</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "NIRSAL Deploys Field Support for CBN’s Anchor Borrowers Programme",
    "content": "<br />As part of its focus on taking business-driven agriculture to the grassroots, the Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agriculture (NIRSAL) is deploying an innovative nation-wide field structure to support 225,000 farmers under the CBN Anchor Borrowers Scheme. The structure, known as the Project Monitoring Reporting and Remediation Office (PMRO), has units located in each state and the Federal Capital.<br /><br />The Central Bank of Nigeria head office in Abuja. The PMROs are designed to support NIRSAL’s core mandate of making agriculture more attractive for private sector investment by de-risking the agricultural value chain. Among other functions, they will provide rigorous monitoring and supervision of NIRSAL facilitated agriculture projects to improve successful outcomes. NIRSAL which the CBN appointed an implementation partner in the Anchor Borrowers Programme, is deploying the PMROs to support an initial number of about 225,000 farmers throughout the country under the programme.&nbsp;<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMQQBe8_Rp0/WdzPymfLTVI/AAAAAAAAAR8/3fsK9lJeErYALMrz830cWVrgCmPLxAIdACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/NIRSAL.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UMQQBe8_Rp0/WdzPymfLTVI/AAAAAAAAAR8/3fsK9lJeErYALMrz830cWVrgCmPLxAIdACPcBGAYYCw/s320/NIRSAL.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>The 225,000 farmers being supported include a minimum of 5,000 farmers in 37 locations – 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory. Speaking on the development, Managing Director/Chief Executive&nbsp; of NIRSAL, Mr. Aliyu Abbati Abdulhameed explained that the PMROs will play an important supportive role because NIRSAL runs a lean operation at its corporate headquarter. In his words: “The PMRO structure is very critical to our operations.<br /><br />Agriculture is a field business. They would act as our eyes to ensure that agricultural projects that we facilitate finance for are executed in line with agreed terms and also serve to extend the reach of our interventions”. He added that the PMROs will also have the responsibility of capturing the impact of NIRSAL’s interventions on communities, individual farmers and other players along the agricultural value chain. “The positive impact made is the justification for our existence so it’s critical to constantly measure and review the impact of our interventions”.<br /><br />The function of the PMRO office in each state is to generate new projects where necessary, supervise existing ones and mobilize the community to support and own as well as enjoy the positive impact of NIRSAL projects.&nbsp; In line with NIRSAL’s focus on business-driven agriculture, the PMROs are led by highly experienced private sector professionals and will deploy private-sector orientation and strategies to drive the projects along agribusiness lines.&nbsp;<br /><br />They will also assist the banks to properly package those projects so that they become bankable. As a Business Development unit, the PMROs will also work to make sure that there are sufficient projects in each state to be funded by NIRSAL. This will be achieved by developing the capacity of those projects in line with the targets of the project, best practice and the specifications of the banks.<br /><br />Dr. Steven Ogidan, the National Coordinating Consultant overseeing the PMRO structure assert&nbsp; that,&nbsp; “the closeness of the PMROs to project sites and the embedding of project monitoring services within the project sites of any project that is more than 500M ensures effective monitoring and reduces the risk of loan diversion”<br /><br /><b>By Destiny Eseaga&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Governor, Central Bank of Nigeria, Godwin Emefiele, has said that the Federal Government will provide cheap funds to farmers at five per cent interest rate to procure agricultural equipment so as to enhance food production.<br /><br />He said this on Thursday at the launch of Ogun State’s produced MITROS rice at the agro services corporation headquarters, Asero, Abeokuta.<br /><br />The CBN governor said the launching of the locally-produced Ofada and parboiled rice varieties was a pointer to the fact that the state government had keyed into the Federal Government’s agricultural revolution programme.<br /><br />Emefiele, who revealed that he was part of the Presidential Task Force on Agricultural Commodities and Production (rice and wheat), that visited Ogun State about 12 months ago, said Governor Ibikunle Amosun did promise the team that it would soon return to launch the state’s own locally-produced rice.<br /><br />He noted that he was happy that the governor “walked his talk,” arguing that the CBN would continue to support efforts aimed at growing the economy and providing employment.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BUxGVyVpXfU/WdcyZphpXEI/AAAAAAAAAQU/iHfehWpqdMIN1Uetnd7Gpl2L9Z1GUsdWQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Bank%2Bof%2BIndustry.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"500\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BUxGVyVpXfU/WdcyZphpXEI/AAAAAAAAAQU/iHfehWpqdMIN1Uetnd7Gpl2L9Z1GUsdWQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Bank%2Bof%2BIndustry.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Emefiele called on smallholder farmers to also embrace rice, cassava and other food commodities’ cultivation, stating that the next phase would be the processing.<br /><br />He said, “During that visit, the governor took us round the three senatorial districts. We saw the fish ponds, we saw the poultries and we saw some rice farms. But he promised that in no distance time, he’s going to invite us and I am happy to be here today to witness this giant stride demonstrated by the rice pyramid that’s right here.<br /><br />“Ogun State continues to demonstrate the urge to support the focus of the government to create jobs and to grow the economy. A country that doesn’t take agriculture seriously is naturally an unserious country.<br /><br />“We are going to be looking at providing cheap funding at no more than five per cent for those who are going to be assessing facilities to acquire agric equipment like threshers, harvesters, or those who will be going into fish farming, or those who will be going into feed mills.”<br /><br />The Kebbi State Governor, Abubakar Bagudu, who is the Chairman, Presidential Task Force on Commodities and Agricultural Production, said Nigeria was capable of producing 50 million tonnes of rice per annum.<br /><br /><br /><br />According to him, all the 36 states in the country have the capability to produce rice.<br /><br />Bagudu stated, “All the 36 states of Nigeria have the capability of producing rice, of course, including the Federal Capital Territory, Abuja.<br /><br />“With rice, I believe we can achieve what we have achieved even with a commodity like crude oil. Because around the world, about 600 million metric tonnes of rice is produced every year, and in Nigeria, we are still producing a little less than 10 million.<br /><br />“Our land size estimated by the Rice Farmers Association indicated that there are about 12 million rice farmers. This suggests that even if an average yield per farmer is the modest five tonnes, we should be producing 50 million tonnes, not under 10 million tonnes that we are currently producing.”<br /><br />Amosun said the Ofada rice was produced, processed and packaged in the state.<br /><br />The governor, who announced that a 50kg would sell for N11,500, said the MITROS brand of rice would be available in markets and departmental stores.<br /><br />Amosun added that his government would continue to partner other state governments and private partners, as the state would not only be known as an industrial hub of the country, but also the agricultural hub.<br /><br />He stated that steps were being taken to restore the cultural heritage the state was known for in the production of the famous Ofada rice.<br /><br />“We have established three processing mills in each senatorial district of the state in Sawonjo, Ogun West; Asero, Ogun Central; and Ijebu North East in Ogun East, to ensure easy access to processing mills by our local farmers towards promoting quality assurance of the product,” he added.<br /><br /><b>By: Samuel Awoyinfa,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Plastic mulch technology has been used to cut down production cost significantly as it effectively suffocates the weeds and reduces cost of labour and herbicide use.<br /><br />Farmers in very dry areas with little rainfall are advised to employ this concept for effective moisture retention and weed management. The technology works with drip irrigation or other irrigation methods.<br /><br />Most farmers have reported significant increase in crop production irrespective of the quality of plastic film used for mulching and the practice is common with short season crops such as tomato, cabbage, maize and cucumbers, and other vegetables as well as in berries production.<br /><br />Also, since the ground is covered, the technology controls soil erosion as no splashing of water occurs, thus invariably also minimising the spread of diseases from one crop to the other.<br /><br />Before putting the plastic film in place, the land should be thoroughly ploughed and harrowed to make the soil texture fine to have a good tilth suitable for making seed beds.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JurtZmnmonM/WeCfHOkDAvI/AAAAAAAAAWc/06lcqK7POPoKUl8ByUekbKT9izhGvzHHACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B8.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"201\" data-original-width=\"251\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JurtZmnmonM/WeCfHOkDAvI/AAAAAAAAAWc/06lcqK7POPoKUl8ByUekbKT9izhGvzHHACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B8.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Uniformly compacted and fertile beds should then be formed manually or by a tractor and should be well moistened, and then fully covered using plastic film and left to last throughout the production season.<br /><br />A point to note however is that farmers must ensure that the right amount of moisture is applied to the soil before wrapping it, and irrigation should only be targeted to the spot where it is needed.<br /><br />Farmers also need to exercise caution when making holes for planting so as to ensure the spacing corresponds carefully with the type of crop he/she hopes to plant.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />One of the biggest challenges that confront beans and grains farmers and merchants in the country is how to effectively control weevils and beetles in their stored products.<br /><br />This has led to the indiscriminate use of excessive chemicals by many grains farmers and merchants to preserve these produce for future sale; as a result, most of the crops have high pesticide residues harmful to human health.<br /><br />Two years ago, the European Union (EU) banned Nigerian beans because of the high level of dichlorvos pesticide residue at 0.3, which was beyond the 0.1 acceptable limit in the beans.<br /><br />Other chemicals like Chlorpyrifos, Cyhalothrin, Dimathoate, Trichlorphon, Omethoate and so on were also discovered in high, unacceptable levels in dried beans for export.<br /><br />These pesticides were either applied in the farm during cultivation or at storage to preserve the beans from weevils<br /><br />To tackle this problem, the Purdue Improved Crop Storage (PICS) system was developed by Larry L. Murdock, professor of Entomology at Purdue University, USA and scientists in Cameroon in a research funded by a USAID and the university’s International Programs in Agriculture.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a3t6azuOhL0/WjupXBbBc9I/AAAAAAAAA9c/9CjE2eg6UY0r28Gmuhmge0n4Uv_VO7UNwCLcBGAs/s1600/Beans.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-a3t6azuOhL0/WjupXBbBc9I/AAAAAAAAA9c/9CjE2eg6UY0r28Gmuhmge0n4Uv_VO7UNwCLcBGAs/s320/Beans.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The PICS consists of two high-density polyethylene plastic bags, and an outer sack of nylon that protects them. It can store grains safely for eight to 12 months without the produce being damaged by insects.<br /><br />To make the technology available to farmers in Nigeria, a company based in Kano State has been given the license to produce the bags for farmers and merchants for grains and beans storage.<br /><br />The system reduces the amount of damage the weevils inflict upon stored beans and other grains.<br /><br />Murduck, on the Purdue University website, stated that the PICS bags are uninhabitable environments for beetles and weevils,” adding that “the keys to the success of PICS are that insect reproduction is essentially stopped quickly and most eventually die of dehydration.”<br /><br />Dr Tahirou Abdoulaye, an Agricultural Economist with the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA), Ibadan stated that the “PICS bags simply eliminate the need to use any chemicals for storage.”<br /><br /><b>Extension expert offers advice on storage</b><br /><br />The block extension supervisor for Tudun Iya Funtua Zonal Office, Katsina State Agricultural and Rural Development Authority (KTARDA), Malam Ahmad Idris, noted that they don’t use or recommend chemicals for maize storage, adding that the only thing a farmer needs to do is to make sure the maize is properly dried before storing it.<br /><br />He explained that maize is properly dried with the onset of the harmattan season - that is from the beginning of November - and that the maize seeds are allowed to dry on their cobs until the cob turns brownish before storing.<br /><br />For cowpea (beans), Malam Ahmad stated that because of insects and other pests, some chemicals may be used for storage. However he recommends that farmers use Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) bags which suffocate all insect pests during storage as no air is allowed into the bag.<br /><br /><b>Chemical control</b><br /><br />Dr Rabiu Adamu, an entomologist from the Crop Protection Department of ABU, Zaria, told Daily Trust that although there are many insecticides that can kill insect pests, only few can be used to control storage insect pests because of strict regulations on their use on foodstuffs.<br /><br />Insecticides that need a long time to degrade and leave residues in the products are unsuitable for use on stored produce.<br /><br />He described the major storage pests of maize as maize weevil Sitophilus zeamais and lesser grain borer Rhizopertha dominica, while for cowpea it is cowpea weevil, Callosobruchus maculates.<br /><br />Dr Adamu offered the following tips on the application of chemicals in maize and cowpea storage:<br /><br /><b>Methods of control of maize and cowpea storage pests&nbsp;</b><br /><br />There are two major ways to apply insecticides in order to control storage pests:<br /><br />By mixing the maize grain with the grain, the pest is killed when it gets in contact with the insecticide protected grains. Recommended insecticides include Dust such as Actellic Dust. Emulsion concentrate can also be used such as Actellic EC.&nbsp; Wettable powders can also be applied such as&nbsp; Carbaryl to protect the grains.<br /><br />Through fumigation, in which the insecticide in gaseous form penetrates the stored product, insects are killed when they inhale the poisonous gas. Example is the use of Aluminum or magnesium phosphide tablets.<br /><br /><b>Recommended rates&nbsp;</b><br /><br />For Dust formulation, Pirimiphos Methyl (Actellic) can be used for shelled maize/cowpea grains, at a rate of 200-500g per 1000kg grains. Dust is a mixture of insecticide with inert powder. It is mixed with grains at the time of storage before the produce is bagged. The produce to be mix with the dust insecticide must be dry and must be evenly mixed.<br /><br />Dust can also be used on floors around the bottom and top of the storage containers. Dust insecticide when properly used could provide protection of 6-9 months. After period of storage the produce must be thoroughly cleaned of the dust before it can use for consumption.&nbsp;<br /><br />Actellic EC can be mixed with water to be sprayed on grains prior to storage. 0.5 - 1 litres in 5- 10 litres of water per 1000 kg of grains.<br /><br />The grains must be thoroughly mixed with the spray liquid and must be properly dried before being bagged for storage.<br /><br />Wettable powders such as Carbaryl (Sevin) can be applied at the rate of 10g per 1000kg of grains. However the powder is not popular with farmers because it is not highly effective against common storage pests of maize and cowpea.<br /><br />The fumigant leaves no marks or discoloration on the stored produce. However it should be noted that fumigant kills only insects which are already in the grain.<br /><br />Fumigants are gases and therefore self-dispersing and non-persistent is the most reliable chemical control of storage pests.<br /><br />They have several advantages over contact poisons due to their ability to penetrate into mass of grains and not leaving residues.<br /><br />For fumigants to be effective, they must be applied where there is air-tight storage condition in sacks, containers or buildings. For bagged produce, the rate is 1-2 tablets per 100 kg grain sack. The tablet is wrapped in small tissue paper and placed in the middle of the sack.<br /><br />The fumigant can provide protection for up to six months provided the storage container is airtight.<br /><br />For any recommended chemical to be effective against storage pests of maize and cowpea:<br /><br />The grains must be harvested as soon they are matured, to avoid infestation in the field because most of the maize and cowpea storage pests are field to store pests.<br /><br />Grains must be properly dried; below 12 percent moisture level before storage.<br /><br />Repair all cracks in walls, floor and roofs to deny insect pests hiding places and dust the stores/ granaries with appropriate contact insecticides such as Permethrin or Pirimiphos Methyl before storing produce.<br /><br />Clean granaries and stores before filling with new grains. A farmer can buy these chemicals from reputable agro chemicals dealers or retailers in towns and cities. They can also buy in large quantities from the manufacturers, distributors or their agents in the big towns<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Ranching as Solution",
    "content": "<br />The call by Dr. Samuel Ortom, the governor of Benue State, for the nationwide adoption of the ranching of cattle could not have come at a better time.<br /><br />The governor was speaking in the wake of the first month of his state’s Open Grazing Prohibition and Establishment of Ranches law, signed into force on November 1. The law restricts the grazing of animals to ranches, limits their movement to rail and truck, and punishes cattle rustling and attacks on farmers, among others. The state’s Livestock Guards has also been inaugurated to help enforce the law.<br /><br />With the arguable exception of Ekiti State’s Governor Ayo Fayose, Ortom has been the nation’s most consistent voice on the viable resolution of the deadly confrontations between herdsmen and sedentary communities that have erupted across the country with increasing frequency.<br /><br />This is unsurprising, because Benue State has been at the epicentre of these disturbances. Renowned for its agricultural prowess, the state has been a major grazing destination for nomadic herdsmen whose clashes with farmers in host communities have resulted in significant losses of life and destruction of property.<br /><br />Between 2013 and 2016, an estimated 1,878 lives were lost in these clashes, with 750 wounded and 200 missing. An estimated N95 billion was lost between 2012 and 2016. Schools, hospitals, bridges and other social infrastructure have been destroyed, and the resultant unrest has negatively impacted commercial and social life throughout the state.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yGRtReVWbp4/WezdScEXjCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/UwwktZ-iJv4XeLJhn2lbLBGkT5wQGz6JQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Ortom.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"334\" data-original-width=\"250\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yGRtReVWbp4/WezdScEXjCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/UwwktZ-iJv4XeLJhn2lbLBGkT5wQGz6JQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Ortom.jpg\" width=\"239\" /></a></div><br />By making the ranching of cattle and other animals mandatory, the law is simply insisting on the modernisation of an activity which has stagnated in the medieval era for far too long.<br /><br />In agricultural superpowers like Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Chile and the United States, ranching has been standard practice for decades. The practice enables animals to be grazed within the confines of ranches which can be hundreds of thousands of acres in size, thereby facilitating their care and processing for agro-allied industry.<br /><br />Instead of being exposed to the elements, vulnerable to cattle rustlers and other hazards, the animals raised on ranches are better protected, are less likely to encroach on farmland, and help put agriculturally unproductive land to better use. Cattle raised on ranches are almost always far more robust and healthier than their open-grazed counterparts.<br /><br />Herdsmen are freed from the rigours of nomadic life, as they are no longer forced to wander across the nation in search of pasture and water for their animals. Their families can enjoy healthcare, education and other benefits of sedentary life without sacrificing their attachment to the cattle they value so highly.<br /><br />The Benue anti open-grazing law has sought to be scrupulously fair by containing safeguards for all parties. Section 19 protects livestock from theft, while Section 20 protects farmers from attacks.<br /><br />Ekiti State was the first to promulgate laws against open-grazing, but Benue State appears to have shown the way forward on the vexed issue of herdsmen-settler clashes. Its combination of consistent advocacy and carefully-worded legislation could succeed where threats and coercion have failed.<br /><br />Much remains to be done, however. The practical concerns raised by stakeholders like the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association of Nigeria (MACBAN) must be addressed. MACBAN has claimed that the process of acquiring land for ranches is difficult and that no provision has been made for legal cattle markets in the state. If these fears are speedily addressed, they might help to reverse the alleged exodus of herdsmen out of the state since November 1.<br /><br />Other states should follow the Benue example. Legislation should not target herdsmen as an ethnic group, nor seek vengeance for the past, but should ensure that cattle-grazing is simultaneously modernised, safe and turned into an economic benefit instead of a security threat.<br /><br /><b>Source: The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Abiola Gbolahan, in his comments, said the association is spread all over the Southwest of&nbsp; Nigeria with about 27,000 members.<br /><br />Gbolahan explained that FADAYEAN has actually been inaugurated in other states, but that it started from Lagos.<br /><br />“Now we are in Delta, Imo and Enugu states. One Dr. Durodolu also took it to South Africa recently. What we are doing now is part of our own promise to the people to empower the youth, market women and farmers.<br /><br />“The problem farmers in Nigeria have is how to get access to the Federal Government. We are trying to complement the efforts of the Federal Government through diversification programme.<br /><br />“People have abandoned agriculture and focus on petroleum and this cannot sustain us. So, we need to diversify. We are getting loans from the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) through the BoI. We usually lease hectares of land to our members,” he said.<br /><br />He pointed out that the association discovered that it was difficult for farmers to get money to cultivate, and that each farmer needed about N70,000, but BOI would give N50,000 to each of the farmers.<br /><br />The loan, he said was extended to those in fish business like the Egwuns and those selling dried fish so that they could get some money for their businesses.<br /><br />He said: “The Federal Government is trying to subsidise the input for farmers such as fertilizers and others. We also have a cooperative society, which is registered with the Lagos State government.<br /><br />“To be a member, you would pay N6,000 and we give each member one hectare of land as we have 400 hectares of land in Badagry,&nbsp; and 500 hectares of land in Ijebu, Ogun State.<br /><br />“So, we give them out to serious people. We can minimise and reduce poverty through this.”<br /><br /><b>By: Oziegbe Okoeki&nbsp;</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Farm sponsors can get between 6-25% returns after harvest depending on the farm type they sponsor.<br /><br />Co-Founder and CEO of Farmcrowdy, Onyeka Akumah, said: “Today’s seed announcement is a remarkable milestone for us and Nigeria’s Agritech industry as a whole – especially having just celebrated the anniversary of our first year of operations in November 2017. It will allow us to build on our earlier traction as we continue to introduce Nigerians to this exciting new category of partnering with farmers for impact and return.<br /><br />“We are happy to amplify our work with the farmers across new states in Nigeria while empowering local farmers by hiring more agriculture technology experts to impart knowledge to ensure best practice in farming methods. We’re thrilled that as a Nigerian start-up operating for just over a year, we have a group of investors who share in the vision and mission of Farmcrowdy as much as we do.”<br /><br />Farmcrowdy recently launched its first mobile app, which provides an accessible platform for agriculture enthusiasts to experience, learn, do their farming business with real farmers and appreciate agriculture practice first-hand through regular updates, images and videos from the farms.<br /><br />According to Cody Simms, Partner, Techstars Ventures, “Onyeka Akumah and the Farmcrowdy team are changing the global dynamics of farming and agriculture. Techstars is proud and honoured to be a continued part of the Farmcrowdy journey via investment from Techstars Ventures, the venture capital arm of Techstars. We first met the Farmcrowdy team at Techstars Atlanta in partnership with Cox Enterprises and were immediately impressed by their vision, execution, and the vast scope of their potential impact to the world.”<br /><br />Cox Enterprises Senior Vice President, Corporate Strategy and Investments, Duncan O’Brien, added, “From the moment we encountered Farmcrowdy, we were very impressed with the work that the start-up is doing to empower Nigeria’s farmers. As our planet faces drastic population growth and manages scarce resources, investing in sustainable agriculture is a venture that will reap long-term benefits for us all.”<br /><br /><b>By Femi Adekoya</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The President of Nigerian Association of Women In Agriculture, NAWIA, Mrs. Ngizan Chahul has appealed to the Benue State House of Assembly to prioritize budgetary allocation to the agricultural sector to ensure sustainable growth and development in the sector.<br /><br />Women rice farmers She spoke at a one day Benue state Legislative Interactive Forum on 2018 Agricultural Budget and State Agricultural Policy Formulation organised by NAWIA and HEDA Resource Centre with Support from Oxfam Nigeria and TrustAfrica held in Makurdi. Mrs. Chahul who commended the state legislature and the executive for ensuring the enactment of the Open Grazing Prohibition Law in the state said the law had reduced the incidences of herdsmen/crop farmers’ conflict that affected farming activities in the past.<br /><br />“Furthermore,the on-going process for Benue state agricultural policy formulation has received legislative support which the Benue state Governor may soon sign into law, is a laudable step towards boosting investors’ morale in agro-processing and the creation of revenue opportunities for the Government, as well as employment for the Benue People, especially the youths.”<br /><br />&nbsp;“The fact is that without a policy the agricultural sector will continue to suffer, but if we have it in place every other thing will fall into place and our state will be happier for it.” Continuing she said, “today, the 2018 budget estimates have been presented to the Benue state House of Assembly, we would like to know the house committee position in debating for the increase in agricultural budget to at least 10% of the total annual state budget as contained in the Maputo Declaration.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eDMvlL1vyCo/WdcySsFdxwI/AAAAAAAAAQY/M_DUfXbGZwg9mNRCt-zFsLFahNPkQiCOQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AGRIC-300x159.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"159\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eDMvlL1vyCo/WdcySsFdxwI/AAAAAAAAAQY/M_DUfXbGZwg9mNRCt-zFsLFahNPkQiCOQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AGRIC-300x159.jpg\" /></a></div>“We all know that Benue State is the FOOD BASKET OF THE NATION. The state is expected to have the highest budget allocation to agriculture to enable the state sustain its appellation. “Employment of agriculture extension officers, revival of moribund agro-processing factories in the state, research, establishment of the agro-processing zones in the state are some of the issues that the increased budget is expected to fund.<br /><br />If this is done, the smallholder farmers that we represent, will have a good market and stable income to improve their livelihood. “We must also appreciate the state government for launching a unified standard measurement for most of the Agro-produce in the state, which has reduced the middlemen exploitations.<br /><br />“We also appreciate the State Ministry of Agriculture for its proactive steps in improving agriculture ln the state. “In a special way, we appreciate Oxfam Nigeria and TrustAfrica for their support Which has made this occasion possible. Mrs. Chahul who lamented the level of post harvest losses recorded in the state, expressed optimism that the deliberation and actions taken by stakeholders in the sector would to a large extent improve the fortunes of state.”<br /><br />&nbsp;On his part, the lead paper presenter, Mr. Justin Gbagir urged the state government to ensure improved commitment to the implementation of its annual budget to better the lot of farmers in the state. “We need to see greater commitment to the implementation of the government policies as contained in the working document of the administration and by so doing we will record unprecedented growth in that sector.<br /><br />&nbsp;“I must however state unequivocally that the situation at the moment is not encouraging but we hope that the government would do better if more funds is committed to the sector.” Gbagir noted. Also speaking, the Chairman of the Appropriation Committee in the House, Mr. Adam Okloho said the House was working to ensure that the 2018 budget was realistic and implementable. Okloho “if we do the right thing everything will fall into place.<br /><br />We do not really need a bogus budget that would not be funded with the meager resources at the disposal of the government because we could end up derailing. “I must however say without contradiction that the 2018 budget has good prospects that will impact the state and the teeming farming populace.<br /><br />“The Governor Samuel Ortom led government has a good dream for our people but we need funds to have it actualized. “My pain is that corruption is also adversely effecting the implementation of budgets because Ministries, Departments and Agencies of government sometimes generate funds but fail to remit same to the coffers of government.<br /><br />&nbsp;“We will take steps to ensure that such practices are checked and also ensure that the budget presented to the House is looked into to ensure that it is implementable and beneficial to the farming populace who are in the majority in the state.” In his contribution, Chairman of the House Standing Committee on Agriculture, Mr. James Gbande stressed that the Assembly would thoroughly dissect and scrutinize the 2018 budget to ensure its implementability.<br /><br />“We will do everything within available resources to ensure that the Agric sector had a fair deal in the budget.” Gbande pleaded with stakeholders in the sector to show understanding, “because as we all know government is contending with limited resources given the economic situation but I can assure you that government will always do the needful to better the lot of our teeming farming populace.”<br /><br />He added. Majority of the stakeholders who spoke at the interactive session appealed to the government to accord greater attention to the agricultural sector where the state enjoys greater comparative advantage to others states in the country and given its potentials to improve the economic fortunes of the state.<br /><b><br /></b><b>By: Peter Duru</b><br /><b><br /></b><b><br /></b><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

This move smacks of sheer insensitivity to the plight of the rural dwellers”. He stated.<br /><br />He, therefore, called on the State governor,&nbsp; Senator Ibikunle Amosun, to wade into the matter and ensure that justice is served in the interest of peace and continuous development of the community and Ogun State at large.<br /><br />Addressing the protesters, Oba Onagoruwa, denied any connivance in the sale of the farmland to foreign investors. But he promised to get in touch with eminent personalities, such as Gen.

    "title": "Total Trains 60 Youths in Agricultural Entrepreneurship",
    "content": "<br />Total Upstream Companies in Nigeria, through its TOTALpreneur programme, has trained 60 youths in agriculture and other basic skills.<br /><br />They were trained at the OFFERCentre Institute of Agriculture in Oluponna, Osun State.<br /><br />During the graduation ceremony, which also held at the institute, the Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer, TUCN, Mr. Nicolas Terraz, said the initiative was part of Total’s Corporate Social Responsibility of making the youth entrepreneurs and job creators.<br /><br />He stated that the organisation was collaborating with the OFFERCentre to train students because it believed in building relationships with stakeholders to ensure trust, transparency and sustainability.<br /><br />Terraz, who was represented at the ceremony by the company’s Executive General Manager for CSR, Mr. Vincent Nnadi, pointed out that about 10 per cent of the beneficiaries had continued with further education in agriculture, while the remaining 90 per cent were engaged positively in their different trades.<br /><br />He said, “The entrepreneurial engagement in agriculture and vocational skills is a deliberate strategic move to develop the youth, fight poverty and eliminate crime.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zf1bTn63NCg/WifBZ0BzIgI/AAAAAAAAA7I/iVcYzgokuIk8OGejVGxutvBm18oy97cJACLcBGAs/s1600/Total.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"401\" data-original-width=\"767\" height=\"167\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-zf1bTn63NCg/WifBZ0BzIgI/AAAAAAAAA7I/iVcYzgokuIk8OGejVGxutvBm18oy97cJACLcBGAs/s320/Total.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“As you know, agriculture has great market potential for small and medium-sized entrepreneurs, while vocational skills are services that are always in need and never out of fashion. These, therefore, provide great outlook for the youth.<br /><br />He added, “Sustainability drives efficiency and efficiency, indeed, drives down costs. We recognise these linkages and indeed apply them to achieve our CSR goals.<br /><br />“We are happy with the success story of the first batch. About 10 per cent of these youths have continued to further their education in agriculture, while the remaining 90 per cent are engaged positively in their different trades.”<br /><br />Under the TOTALPreneur-OFFER Centre partnership, 30 youths received training in agriculture (fish farming, animal husbandry, pottery and crop production); while another 30 youths were trained in catering and hotel management, events management, cake and pastry making.<br /><br />All 60 trainees also received training in business management, computer operation, accounting and marketing.<br /><br />The best student in catering, Miss Elizabeth Okpara, said the training had impacted entrepreneurial skills on her and taught her how to start and grow a business successfully.<br /><br />“Here, I learnt how to go to the world and take it on. I used to be afraid of starting a business, but with the training here, I can go to any length. Even if I fall, I will rise again,” Okpara stated.<br /><br />The Rector of the institute, Rev. Macarius Olatunji, while commending the TUNC, said, “What we are celebrating today is not just the graduation of another set of TOTALpreneurs, but the success of this project that is extremely important for the sustainable development of our people and the country at large.<br /><br />“More than 1,650 candidates applied for the programme from across the country, out of which 60 were chosen. It is a sign that people are keying into the initiative.”<br /><br />The guest lecturer, Dr. Siyansola Omitoyin, tasked the beneficiaries to make use of all the ideas they learnt to become job creators rather than job seekers.<br /><br />“The challenges are there, but you have been trained in the ability to overcome challenges. You have acquired the skills to tackle risks. Always think out of the box. It is the unique things that you do that will stand you out,” she added.<br /><br /><b>Source: Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Forest cover depletes at 5 per cent statistics say<br /><br />Nigeria is number four on the list of top 10 countries reporting the greatest annual net loss of forest area, with an annual forest area net loss of 410,000 hectares.<br /><br />However, the relevant government agencies and institutions including the Nat<br /><br />ional Parks Service and the Forestry Institute of Nigeria (FRIN) are not to blame.<br /><br />This is according to the Professor LabodePopoola, Director, UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network, Nigeria.<br /><br />The professor who is also the Vice Chancellor, Osun State University, Osogbo, instead laid the blame on the failure of members of the general public to engage in sustainable practices such as tree-planting.<br /><br />Delivering the lead paper at the ninth annual conference of the Institute of Ecology and Environmental Studies, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, last week, the professor of Forest Economics and Sustainable Development insisted that these government bodies were doing their best, but needed the cooperation of the public to deliver on their mandate.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KW3UolZJjgY/Wia1XQrUZCI/AAAAAAAAA64/nHyE7UGdVZ8ruDjtf9tpbBSPcmwPuHihwCLcBGAs/s1600/Forest.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KW3UolZJjgY/Wia1XQrUZCI/AAAAAAAAA64/nHyE7UGdVZ8ruDjtf9tpbBSPcmwPuHihwCLcBGAs/s320/Forest.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Professor Popoola told Ecoscope that “it is not FRIN that is destroying the forests; it is not the National Parks Services that is destroying the forests. It is you and I. We should be planting trees. Imagine if you plant a tree every year when you mark your birthday, if you live up to 70 and you are 30 now, you would have lanted 40 trees. We are too destructive, we are too wasteful. Those who are destroying the forests are not researchers. They are not necessarily the policy makers. They are people like you and I. FRIN is trying its best, other organisations are also doing their best. But the people are the problem.”<br /><br />He went on to say that it was not necessary to create more agencies for sustained awareness on environmental issues to be achieved. “We already have too many of them. All we need to do is collective action, collective affirmation, and individually we must buy into everything that is good that will help this country to develop.”<br /><br />Statistics put the annual rate of forest loss in Nigeria at 5 per cent.<br /><br /><b>By: Paul Omorogbe Ecoscope</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigeria To Save N127bn In Forex With Cassava Bread",
    "content": "<br />With over $6 billion spent annually on the importation of wheat, the director general of Federal Institute of Industrial Research (FIIRO), Prof. Gloria Elemo, has said Nigeria can save up to N127 billion in foreign exchange through the adoption of cassava bread.<br /><br />In an interview with LEADERSHIP in Lagos, she said much more foreign exchange can be saved with full substitution of wheat flour for bread with cassava flour as the N127 billon will be saved with only 20 per cent substitution.<br /><br />Elemo noted that this figure will, however, be N63.5 billion at 10 per cent substitution. “Again, no matter how you look at it, whether in the short term or in the long term, bread is going to be cheaper and affordable through inclusion of cassava flour. Prices of bread could be reduced by 20-45 percent at 20 per cent inclusion in the long term, if policy adopted.<br /><br />She went on: “We have carried out consumers’ acceptability studies on cassava bread produced at various levels of inclusion of high quality cassava flour and the response is very encouraging. But also, one may not rule out some resistance from some quarters due to reluctance to change but change is one thing that is inevitable”.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SDOXsH2-lys/WiayRQl8vsI/AAAAAAAAA6o/XA_zTM4tq9Er6wNlGKWKcjtuueL4Lp8SQCLcBGAs/s1600/Cassava%2BBread.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"358\" data-original-width=\"640\" height=\"179\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-SDOXsH2-lys/WiayRQl8vsI/AAAAAAAAA6o/XA_zTM4tq9Er6wNlGKWKcjtuueL4Lp8SQCLcBGAs/s320/Cassava%2BBread.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Dr. Elemo stressed that some have actually said that cassava bread would cause diabetes or aggravate diabetic condition but as scientists, “we have been able to debunk this through Glycemic Index (GI) studies using human samples.<br /><br />“The subjects consumed the cassava bread and we monitored the effect on the blood glucose. Interestingly, at 20 per cent inclusion, even at 10 per cent inclusion, there has been a slight drop in the GI for both bread than it is with bread baked with 100 per cent wheat flour.&nbsp; So there is no threat and it is not the cause of diabetes. Rather, I will even say it is better to use it for management of diabetes. Cassava bread is safe just like wheat bread for human consumption”, she added.<br /><br />She maintained that it would get to a time when the nation would have more than enough cassava to export. “Presently, there are demands in the export market for cassava but because it is out food security crop we are using it extensively for foods like garri, fufu, so it is not easy to meet export demand. But by the time the value chain is pulled, there will be need for us to increase production.&nbsp; A country like China is in high demand for our cassava”, she added.<br /><br />The institute therefore promised to train more entrepreneurs on its research and development, saying this would in a way reduce the importation of items that can be produced here.<br /><br /><b>By Taiwo Ogunmola-Omilani, Lagos&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

We did that to ensure that we have nothing to hide. We don’t have anything to hide except having good governance at all levels; we don’t have anything to hide except the desire for our leaders to do justice to all mankind no matter who is involved.<br /><br />“When we make such comments, it is to alert our political leaders on their responsibilities. When we don’t do that, almighty God will ask us on the day of judgement, that’s why we keep on talking about this, and will never call on anybody to take up arms.

We will discuss this during the meeting to see how we can assist our various authorities on how to bring this to the minimum level.<br /><br />“The abuse of drugs by women and youth is a very serious issue; we will discuss that and other insecurity issues affecting this country.<br /><br />We will also discuss the issue of IDPs, because, I was told there are about 50 thousand orphans in each camp. Children who don’t know who their parents are. If we allow those children to grow up in IDP camps without knowing who their parents are, then we have a big problem in our hands. Nobody will later&nbsp; know of their wherabouts.<br /><br />“This is among the issues we are to discuss, and there’s possibility that some of us will adopt them after discussion with various government officials in their&nbsp; various camps.&nbsp; We can take some of them as our own children. We have started doing that, we have taken 150 children, and we will educate them to the highest level. We will call on others interested to do that as well.<br /><br />“During this session, we will discuss some of those issues that are of concern, like the herdsmen/farmers clash, the various irresponsible killings of innocent women and&nbsp; children, that people don’t want to talk about. We must talk about these things and we call on the governors never to keep away those things from their tables; we can not keep such things under the carpet because if we do that, we are encouraging more of such dastardly acts to be carried out by others.<br /><br />“We have seen how innocent people have been killed, innocent children of two years, pregnant women killed, children brought out of their mothers womb.&nbsp; I don’t know the type of people we&nbsp; are.<br /><br />“These are the issues we are saying we will never stop talking about, our political leaders should take the responsibility up and help us out, so we can have peace. Without justice, there won’t be peace. “<br /><br />“So, we will discuss some of these issues amicably&nbsp; in a public manner, so that when comments are made publicly, they are not misconstrued to be people calling for war or instability in the country.”<br /><br />According to Chairman of Enugu State Council of Chiefs, Igwe Lawrence Agubuzu:&nbsp; “We saw that the Northern traditional rulers are conducting their affairs in the open and I believe this is in line with the person of who the Sultan of Sokoto is.<br /><br />“I believe strongly that if government listens to the advice of the Sultan, many things would go right, because he has the country at heart and frank on issues that concern the country.<br /><br />“We want traditional rulers to support the call for an additional state for the South East to show that the South East&nbsp; is equally treated fairly like other regions in the country.<br /><br />“We are looking forward to when those around the President would behave like him,&nbsp; that is selfless, incorruptible and up right.” .<br /><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Implementing Anti-open Grazing Laws",
    "content": "<br />The editorial of The PUNCH on Thursday, November 30, 2017 refers.<br /><br />The claim of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association that “anti-grazing laws are… to destroy our means of livelihood” should be viewed in the proper context. The reality is that the Fulani and the 14 other ethnic groups engaged in cattle herding in Nigeria, are unfamiliar with any other method of producing cattle apart from open grazing. It should be taken as a cry for help. It is true that cattle production is an economic activity which is in the private sector, but we are in a unique situation. To put our 19.5 million cattle (using the figure in the editorial) into ranches will require a significant effort from many institutions, groups and individuals. John T. Taiwo, a registered animal scientist and the Director of the Department of Animal Husbandry Services in the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, has estimated that it will cost about N1.1m to establish one hectare of improved pasture plot with chain link perimeter fencing and entrance gate. Technically, ranching requires knowledge and skills in the areas of range management, animal production, animal health, and business management which the traditional pastoralists lack and will need time to acquire.<br /><br />The infrastructural requirements for ranching are basically three: Grazing land to provide grass and legumes to feed the animals; fencing to keep them from straying into crop farms; and water for the animals to drink. A ranch can be a fenced natural (i.e. unplanted) grassland, a sort of “grazing reserve”. The Minister of Agriculture, Audu Ogbeh, confirms that there are 415 grazing reserves with a total land area of above four million hectares in the country. With a very good grass species, the carrying capacity of one hectare is about four mature beef cattle. For 20 million cattle, we need about five million hectares of natural pasture. In 14 grazing reserves, one each in Adamawa, Bauchi, Borno, Gombe, Jigawa, Kaduna, Katsina, Kwara, Niger, Oyo, Sokoto, Yobe, Zamfara and the FCT, there has been infrastructural development by making available improved pasture seeds of Napier grass (which are available from commercial seed companies in Nigeria), establishment of 50 hectares pasture seed multiplication centres, and provision of solar and wind mill-powered boreholes. For the number of cattle we have, our ranches should focus on deliberately sown pastures using improved grass and legume seeds and supplementing with cotton seed cake, salt lick and vitamin-mineral block. Sown pasture ranches can easily carry up to 10 animals per hectare instead of four animals that the natural grassland ranches can carry. That means we will need only about two million hectares of land instead of five million.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qn0I5QzVXyw/WiZQQNezJ2I/AAAAAAAAA6I/B8Ies9K01RcsXqXT4sH7avC_vHJKIouIQCEwYBhgL/s1600/Grazing.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-qn0I5QzVXyw/WiZQQNezJ2I/AAAAAAAAA6I/B8Ies9K01RcsXqXT4sH7avC_vHJKIouIQCEwYBhgL/s320/Grazing.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>It is necessary to use cattle breeds that will perform well in ranches. The Bunaji (or White Fulani) is the most commonly known cattle breed but it is just one of the four indigenous breeds that have been recommended for ranching because they have high yield potential. The other three are: Wadara, Sokoto Gudali and Adamawa Gudali, according to Baba Yusuf Abubakar, a Fulani from Gombe State, a professor of animal breeding and the former Executive Secretary of the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria. He asserts that these four breeds can meet the requirement for modern beef production without cross-breeding with imported exotic breeds. I have advocated the 14 FMARD Livestock Investigation and Breeding Centres to be converted into Cooperative Livestock Innovation and Breed Multiplication Centres to serve the Livestock Producers Associations such as MACBAN as test stations for animal performance, feed and equipment. For ranching to succeed, there must be emphasis on genetic evaluation and breed improvement of cattle.<br /><br />The greater challenge is to build the capacity for ranch management and to assist the cattle herders in proper utilisation of the ranches. In 2016, capacity building of pastoralists was carried out in Kaduna, Jigawa and Niger states in collaboration with the Allan Savoury Institute. That ranching will take a long time to become established had been recognised by all stakeholders in the cattle industry. But when and how should it be started nationwide has been a major point of disagreement. The anti-open grazing laws have provided the golden opportunity to start ranching development immediately. The question remaining is: How?<br /><br />For this, we need to learn from how commercial poultry production came to be established in Nigeria, particularly in south western Nigeria. Commercial poultry became established in the South-West because the Government of Western Nigeria promoted it by: consistent extension training of potential commercial poultry farmers; establishment of poultry breeder farms to supply day old chicks (e.g.at Agege, Lagos and Iwo Oloba, Osun); support for the establishment of Livestock Feeds Ltd by Pfizer in Ikeja, Lagos; and the support for locally produced eggs by strategic location of MANR Kiosks(e.g. outside the Kingsway Store at Dugbe, Ibadan which sold imported eggs).<br /><br />I agree with Jinadu Maina, a Fulani, a Veterinary Doctor and former Director of the defunct Department of Livestock and Pest Control Services of FMARD, that commercial cattle production needs a similar approach. It is, therefore, recommended that such concerted efforts be made by the 21 cattle producing states which already have grazing reserves that can be centres for the development of clusters of cattle ranches.<br /><br />We have a long history of cattle ranching to draw lessons from both our successes and failures which include the establishment of: government dairy farms in Vom, Plateau and Agege, Lagos in the 1940s; LIBCs in many locations in the 1950s; public-private-partnerships for smallholder fattening schemes in many locations in the 1960s; state cattle ranches in most Northern states in the 1970s; special cattle ranches in Mokwa, Niger, Adada, Enugu, and Fasola, Oyo, in the 1970s to 1980s; private cattle ranches that are functioning even now (e.g. Maizube Farms, Niger, and L&amp;Z Integrated Farms, Kano).<br /><br />On the political front, President Muhammadu Buhari in July 2015, constituted a committee on Strategic Action Plan for the Development of Grazing Reserves and Stock Routes nationwide. One of the committee’s Terms of Reference was to develop short, medium and long-term strategic recommendations that will end the persistent farmers and pastoralists’ conflicts in the country. The short term recommendation was the establishment of a National Programme on Grazing Reserves and Stock Route Development. The Federal Government is also proposing a form of political solution through negotiation and dialogue with state governors to grant land for grazing reserves in their states, with a promise of funds to develop such reserves. There is a proposed bill currently pending before the National Assembly to establish a Federal Commission to Cater for and Manage Transhumant Stock Routes and Grazing Reserve Areas. All these political actions should be modified to include ranching. Hence, to implement the anti-open grazing laws, we should establish a National Programme on Ranching, Grazing Reserves and Stock Route Development; a Federal Commission to Cater for and Manage Ranches, Transhumant Stock Routes and Grazing Reserve Areas. Interested states can be encouraged to “key in” into these federal initiatives towards a National Ranch Development Plan. If we can establish 100,000 ha of ranches in 2018, that is already five per cent of the total land area needed for accommodating all our cattle on ranches. That should be a valve to release the pent-up emotions, prevent further conflicts and enable all livelihoods of herders and farmers to be protected. The National Programme, Federal Commission and National Ranch Development Plan can continue the development of our cattle industry.<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp; Sonaiya is Professor of Animal Science, Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Osun State<br /><b>By: Babafunso Sonaiya</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The United Nations (UN), African Union (AU), Oxfam and other developmental organisations have urged governments in the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to enact laws and policies that would enhance women participation in agricultural development.<br /><br />They were speaking at a two-day conference on “Promoting Gender Equality in Agricultural Land Investments in Africa”, organised by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD), Oxfam, ECOWAS Parliament and Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).<br /><br />They unanimously agreed that laws and policies that are targeted at empowering women, particularly in the ownership of land, which is a major factor in agriculture, would go a long way in fast-tracking development in Africa.<br /><br />According to the representative of the Food and Agriculture of the UN Tacko Ndiaye, despite the widespread recognition of women’s contributions to food security and nutrition in their household and communities, they have continued to be discriminated against.<br /><br />“Compared to their male counterparts, they have less secure access to productive resources, employment opportunities, markets, and rural services.

Due to lack of legal ownership, women in most communities have been disadvantaged where private companies acquire and compensate 'legal’ landowners by virtue of documents of ownership.”<br /><br />On his part the Speaker of the ECOWAS Parliament, Moustapha Cesse Lo, said that the Parliament was synergizing with development partners as part of the effort to enhance women’s participation in agricultural investment in Africa and that targeting female producers in agriculture would help to boost agricultural practice in the community, hence, the need to address under-development of women in agriculture.<br /><br />By Abbas Jimoh<br />Daily Trust News<div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Anti-grazing Law: Farmers Decry Destruction of Farmlands, Lack of Security in Boundary Communities",
    "content": "<br />Tension has risen within the&nbsp; Benue Nasarawa border communities over destruction of hundreds of farmlands by migrating Fulani herders who cross into Nasarawa State as a result of implementation of the anti open grazing law in Benue state.<br /><br />The affected farmers told Daily Trust recently that the herders&nbsp; destroyed crops in many farmlands yet to be harvested worth millions&nbsp; of naira in Tsegbenyi, Doga, Jangargari, Abujan Ganye Madidid in Tunga area, and other boundary settlements along edge of river Benue in Awe LGA of Nasarawa state.<br /><br />Our correspondent who visited the boundary communities in Awe LGA, observed total absence of security in the entire boundary communities, with the exception of&nbsp; a few vigilantes. During the visit Tuesday this reporter alongside some journalists witnessed some of the migrating&nbsp; herders and their cattle inside some rice farms&nbsp; in Doga village, a settlement along boundary with Benue state in Awe LGA of Nasarawa State.<br /><br />Residents of the boundary communities told Daily Trust that the herders are using force in dispersing the farmers with sporadic gunshots before and after entering farmlands, leaving the farmers helpless and&nbsp; currently living in threat, and fear of the unknown.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qn0I5QzVXyw/WiZQQNezJ2I/AAAAAAAAA6E/on27o6w-6r4maR47SokEHYv8re8nbjtDACLcBGAs/s1600/Grazing.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-qn0I5QzVXyw/WiZQQNezJ2I/AAAAAAAAA6E/on27o6w-6r4maR47SokEHYv8re8nbjtDACLcBGAs/s320/Grazing.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />One of the affected farmers, Nyishir Joseph, said that the migrating&nbsp; herders stormed his rice farm with hundreds of cows Sunday evening in Tsegbenyi, Awe LGA, “shooting sporadically and cows eating&nbsp; up the entire farmland. I am just planning to harvest my rice farm ,and I am expecting about 80 to 100 bags of rice. They have destroyed everything in the farm as you can see,” Joseph said.<br /><br />“Thank God none of us got injured from their gunshots. We went&nbsp; back because if we try to face them, they may likely kill&nbsp; &nbsp;all of us with the kind of weapons they were carrying, and set fire to&nbsp; our houses&nbsp; and also destroy&nbsp; our properties. We are currently helpless because of the absence of security in the border. We are appealing to the government to come to our aid by providing&nbsp; security operatives along the boundaries.”<br /><br />Another victim, Nobody Ubur, seen&nbsp; very sober in his destroyed farm in Tsegbenyi told Daily Trust that the herders invaded his rice farm in&nbsp; broad daylight in Tsegbenyi, firing gunshots from different directions, “We ran for our safety to a distant hill where we were watching helplessly how their cattle destroyed our crops and means of livelihood. I am expecting 120 bags of local rice in three of my farms that were destroyed. I have two wives and 15 children. This farm is the only means of survival for me and my family.”<br /><br />After they finished the destruction of my farms. They moved their cattle to the riverside to drink, and they proceeded by crossing the river and returning&nbsp; to Benue state. We are currently living in fear and threat for our lives, because we cannot defend ourselves with machete, daggers bow and arrow, while the herders are carrying sophisticated weapons. We don’t know whether they will still comeback.”<br /><br />“I am appealing both to&nbsp; the state and federal governments to come to our aid, especially&nbsp; our crops that were destroyed by these herders, and compensate us so that we do not&nbsp; descend&nbsp; into hunger and starvation. We&nbsp; are also appealing to the government to provide security in the boundary communities, to forestall future occurrence and maintenance of peace.”<br /><br />One other victim, who is also the village head of Tsegbenyi, Samuel Obur, said that residents of boundary communities are living in fear since arrival of&nbsp; the migrating&nbsp; Fulani herders in the area.<br /><br />Obur Obur, said, “Our greatest challenge now in the boundary settlement is our safety. The herders entered&nbsp; my rice farm yesterday when&nbsp; I was&nbsp; about to harvest, and destroyed the entire crops, which is more&nbsp; than 80 bags. You have no right to challenge them because they carrying heavy guns. If you move near them, they shoot you.”<br /><br />“The level of impunity going in this village is beyond imagination, but what is keeping us in suspense is their action between Sunday evening and Monday morning, as hundreds of them move their cattle across the river Benue through Anyishi, Logo LGA with thousands of their cattle back to Benue state. We are really afraid of their return. We don’t have security here. The only one seen&nbsp; is some pockets of vigilante who cannot address the situation.”<br /><br />Felix Ugbir, whose farms were destroyed by the herders in Tsegbenyi, Awe LGA, told our correspondent that the herders swarmed&nbsp; his farm with hundreds of cows and sheep, “ I am&nbsp; a farmer and farming is the only means of livelihood, I don’t have any skills or&nbsp; techniques to do any business ,and now the herders have&nbsp; overrun all my farm produce.”<br /><br />Another victim affected whose farm was also destroyed in Abujan Ganye Madidi Ibrahim Awilo in a telephone interview said that the migrating&nbsp; Fulani herders entered&nbsp; his rice farm at Ganye Madidi, settlement, in Tunga, Awe LGA, saying, “When one sibling and a colleague talked to the herders they brought&nbsp; out weapons and threatened&nbsp; to kill&nbsp; them. They took to their heels for safety. They destroyed the entire crops in the farm.”<br /><br />One of&nbsp; the migrating&nbsp; Fulani herders Jibrin Musa, who journeyed from Agoma in Benue, found grazing his cattle in Fantaki community in Awe, told Daily Trust that most of&nbsp; the destruction&nbsp; of the farms were done out of fear and suspense coupled with lack of enough grasses.<br /><br />“Our major challenge&nbsp; is the food and water for our cattle. There is not&nbsp; enough grass and water to graze our cattle in most of the boundary communities. Many of the migrating&nbsp; herders are not used to these&nbsp; kind of conditions. I don’t think&nbsp; the destruction of farmlands is deliberate. We are trying our best not&nbsp; to destroy the crops of&nbsp; farmers. Many herders swarm&nbsp; into farms on account&nbsp; of the present situation. There is no grass for the cattle not&nbsp; to talk of food for our children, a good number are confused conditions.” Musa said.<br /><br />The Commander of the Vigilante Group of Nigeria (VGN) Awe branch, Salihu Idris Ashafa, attributed the many incidents of destruction of farmlands to lack of&nbsp; security personnel in the villages and other boundary settlements along the river Benue,&nbsp; “Government needs to support the vigilantes with logistics support, like mobility to effectively patrols the area and stipend to motives the members.”<br /><br />Ashafa said, “You have gone and seen&nbsp; the terrain yourself, the migrating&nbsp; herders find a free environment to plunge&nbsp; into&nbsp; the farmlands of helpless farmers. We have few spirited individuals who voluntarily sacrifice&nbsp; their lives and motorcycles to patrol or intervene in security challenges in the area. There is no support from any quarter&nbsp; to the vigilantes. If there are enough vigilantes and logistics support, the destruction could not have taken place, or damages could not be much.”<br /><br />Another farmer who migrated from Akoro in Benue state Sale Umaru, now in Fantaki area of Awe LGA, said that most of the destruction of farmlands were caused&nbsp; by the attitude of the farmers who blocked major cattle routes in the area.<br /><br />Umaru said, “When we cross the river Benue into Nasarawa State there was an existing cattle route for over 100 years that the farmers blocked and cultivated their crops along&nbsp; those cattle routes. The number of cattle that cross&nbsp; cannot wait for anyone to clear their route. In some areas even access road that human beings&nbsp; use is also blocked, coupled with the absence of enough grasses in the area. Go round into the whole of these areas you will observe farmlands crossing the cattle route, so many cases of destruction of farmlands are&nbsp; as&nbsp; a result of the blockage of cattle routes.”<br /><br />When contacted over the absence of security men in the boundary communities, Nasarawa State Police Public Relation Officer, Idrisu Kennedy, said that the command has&nbsp; a mobile police team which patrols the surrounding villages, but argued that it doesn’t have stationed police formations within the settlements.<br /><br />Kennedy added that following the influx of the migrating&nbsp; Fulani herders, the state commissioner deployed more to the areas, and they are working with the joint security task force, which include the traditional rulers, vigilantes and other security agents to ensure the maintenance of law and order in the affected areas.<br /><br /><b>By Hassan Ibrahim,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Maggot Farming can Keep you Smiling to Bank",
    "content": "<br />Maggot farming has come to stay because it has moved from its primitive stage where it was only an activity and hobby, to what it is today – a line of business.<br /><br />With the growing cost of animal feed, maggots are beginning to become a thriving business as experts say that African entrepreneurs have huge opportunity to make millions from it. Maggots come from flies. When flies lay eggs, the eggs pass through several stages before they turn into flies.<br /><br />Research has shown that as a matter of fact, maggots can be a good and suitable substitute for soybeans and fishmeal, which are core ingredients in animal feed. Maggots can be used to feed fish, poultry birds, ducks, pigs, ostrich, guinea fowl and other animals.<br /><br />Investigation by Daily Sun revealed that a company in South Africa called AgriProtein, the pioneer of maggot farming, set up the world’s largest fly farm, propelling the use of insects as livestock feed beyond academic theory to a commercial venture where they extract maggots to produce feed.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C18XGSqj95A/WiVY87dOZXI/AAAAAAAAA50/zLSmQAir_sIL36FD5TN5sUG5doKj5VfwgCLcBGAs/s1600/Maggot%2Bfarm.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"143\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-C18XGSqj95A/WiVY87dOZXI/AAAAAAAAA50/zLSmQAir_sIL36FD5TN5sUG5doKj5VfwgCLcBGAs/s1600/Maggot%2Bfarm.jpg\" /></a></div>In South Africa today, they no longer use fishmeal to prepare feed for livestock because they have estimated that if they continue to catch fish from the sea, by 2020 or 2025, fishes may go into extinction as consumers’ demand for livestock keep increasing. At the recent first Insects to Feed World Conference, held in Wageningen, Netherlands, scientists revealed that insects promise to be an economically viable alternative source of high-quality livestock protein that leave a substantially smaller environmental footprint. They also emphasised the need to lessen the drain on the planet’s resources by decreasing consumption of expensive and unsustainable animal protein feeds as the human population is growing.<br /><br />But in Nigeria, the new business opportunity is yet to be explored as people are still doubting it. But the truth is that there is money in maggots farming and it needs a little capital of between N35,000 and N40,000 to start after receiving training from an expert. Today, one of the biggest challenges facing livestock farming is cost of feed, hence, the best alternative to cut cost is rearing of maggots to feed the poultry birds and animals.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, Richard Agbugba of Waste2Wealth Initiatives, a division of Rina Ventures, in Abuja, said there is need for farmers to embrace maggots’ farming because it would remove about 75 per cent cost of production both in fish and poultry farming.<br /><br />According to him, there is money in maggots’ farming because from Colorado to South Africa, the maggot market is heating up and helping solve the problem of ever soaring high cost of fish and soybean meals, which are the two most important ingredients in poultry, pork and fish feed production.<br /><br />He added: “So instead of incurring these huge costs, some forward looking entrepreneurs are turning to maggots’ farming through a technically designed self-harvesting bin – no mess, no smell! In the maggot bin, female flies lay about 500 eggs apiece daily. This produces an army of hungry larvae that eat their way through mounds of food waste. And they do eat fast! 1kg of fly eggs produces 380kg of larvae protein in just three days!<br /><br />“There is no way one will keep up with demand if venturing into this lucrative business. For instance, a 25kg bag of poultry feed costs N4,000 or more. Imagine producing five-10 bags of magmeal (maggot meal) for a start! Even if one decides to sell at N2,500 per bag knowing that the maggots cost nothing to produce, the person is heading towards making millions in a few months.”<br /><br />He said that few things trigger repulsion like the sight of maggots writhing through rotten food or decomposing road kill, adding that maggots, which are the larvae stage of houseflies and other related insects, are actually one of nature’s unsung heroes.<br /><br />However, he described the golden creatures as the future heroes that could help save the world by recycling waste nutrients and generating sustainable protein. In chicken and fish production, he said maggot protein has been shown to produce better weight gain and less gizzard erosion.<br /><br />He said the feed from maggot is more nutritious and helps pigs and chickens grow faster and bigger, which is what they are exploring now in South Africa. Other countries are even inviting South Africa to come and replicate what they have done in their country.<br /><br />He said: “Here in Nigeria, it’s like a new concept and people still doubt it but the truth is that we are doing it and we are benefiting from it. But when people start coming for training, let them see and believe. People who have undergone training are now giving testimonies that it is real. That is why we are in the maggots’ farming business because we want to leverage on the vast opportunities available in the agriculture industry to contribute our quota in growing the Nigerian economy, and to export maggots from Nigeria to other countries and make profit.”<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Importation of poultry and poultry products through any means is also illegal and prohibited. The Federal Government would like to warn that there are serious health hazards associated with these illegally imported frozen products.”<br /><br />The ministry said the health hazards were due to failure in the maintenance of cold chain and wrong handling of the imported products, adding that frozen fish and poultry meat become unwholesome for human consumption as a result of chemicals used in their preservation.<br /><br />“More so, there are bacterial contaminants due to poor handling that can cause serious health challenges.

    "title": "How to Manage Egg Breakage by Layer Chickens",
    "content": "<br />Egg breakage by layer chickens is something most poultry farmers are familiar with.<br /><br />An expert, Musa Abdulrahman of National Animal Production Research Institute (NAPRI), noted that the trend is an acquired behaviour which doesn’t necessarily have a causative agent, adding however that a number of reasons could lead to it.<br /><br />Abdulrahman pointed out that the behaviour is not seasonal and that it is more peculiar with layer birds because their nests are around them.<br /><br />He suggested that part of the reasons for this is congestion, otherwise known as high stocking density of the birds which may lead to cannibalism and also egg breaking.<br /><br />“If the chickens are overcrowded and there is no space for them, they try to create space for themselves so they peck on other chickens and on eggs around to create space.<br /><br />“As a result of pecking on eggs, they break it. Mostly they are attracted to bright colours; red, yellow and green. So on breaking the eggs, the layers feed on the albumen (egg white) thinking its water before feeding on the yolk,” he explained.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wj35Jzw57-I/Wh_hlfqBRFI/AAAAAAAAA48/IBJ6UNKY8aINa4Zdl6aQyGV-aeRGj49JwCLcBGAs/s1600/Layers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Wj35Jzw57-I/Wh_hlfqBRFI/AAAAAAAAA48/IBJ6UNKY8aINa4Zdl6aQyGV-aeRGj49JwCLcBGAs/s320/Layers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The expert stated also that a point to note is that once they acquire the behaviour of egg breaking, it continues, adding that egg breaking at times is as a result of blood stains on the egg or when the eggs are shell-less which attract the chickens to it.<br /><br />Additionally, he said, another cause may be lack of minerals e.g. calcium either in their feed or in their body.<br /><br />“When there is nutritional deficiency, they start pecking around to see what they can find. In addition, if there is no sufficient feed in the feed trays, or if there are no sufficient feeders and drinkers around it also leads to pecking at eggs,” he said.<br /><br />On management of egg breaking, he said the recommendation is that birds are de-beaked using an automatic machine called de-beaker which could also be done manually to reduce its sharpness.<br /><br />De-beaking the birds early ensures that they do not get a taste of the eggs so that the issue of cannibalism does not happen in the first place.<br /><br />To de-beak a chicken, he advised that one should place his/her finger in between the upper and the lower beak to push the tongue inside to avoid cutting it in the process.<br /><br />“In each of the birds you make sure that the upper beak is divided into three equal portions and you remove the outer portion, i.e. one-third of the beak while for the lower beak you should remove one-fourth of the beak,” he advised.<br /><br />He explained further that the upper beak is harder and longer than the lower beak and it’s what the birds use for breaking the eggs, so by de-beaking, the lower beak becomes longer which only allows the bird to scoop feed and not waste eggs.<br /><br />He said some farms de-beak layer birds as early as when they are three to four weeks old, and done again at nine weeks, and then lastly at 15 to 16 weeks before they start laying eggs.<br /><br />He advised poultry farmers to ensure that the birds are fed their nutritional requirement and a good stocking density kept.<br /><br />Similarly, an animal scientist and seasoned poultry farmer, Malam Rabo Danhassan, also affirmed that overstocking of layer birds kept under the deep litter system leads to egg breaking by layer chicken. He noted that sickness or disease in the birds also leads to the behaviour, stating further that it is more common in white feathered poultry birds and could even be seen in day old chicks.<br /><br />On management, he advised that the farmer should identify what caused the behaviour, whether it is due to over stocking, nutrient deficiency or insufficient feed.<br /><br />He also advised that sunlight penetration should be minimised in the poultry house, and electric bulbs should be used instead to divert the birds’ attention from breaking eggs.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Catfish farmers using earthen ponds, surface tanks, plastic tanks etc. often face the challenge of high fingerlings mortality rates when raising them.<br /><br />As such, utmost care need to be exercised in handling these fragile fishes in order to optimise production and profit.<br /><br />A healthy pond grooms healthy fishes. Prior to stocking, 250kg of lime should be applied per acre of pond surface. Also ensure that other unwanted wastes and organisms like frog are cleared before stocking the pond.<br /><br />Fingerlings are most vulnerable when they are less than 10g in size, thus the highest mortality rates occur during this period.<br /><br />Over stocking the pond also leads to high mortality. This is because they need to be fed with a relatively large quantity of feed which will thus result in higher amount of waste released into the pond.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M6b4KMAZikk/Wh_hGms6wAI/AAAAAAAAA40/FmWWp73VIFAwUgv-hX5gQECxT4lmUfETwCLcBGAs/s1600/Fingerlings.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-M6b4KMAZikk/Wh_hGms6wAI/AAAAAAAAA40/FmWWp73VIFAwUgv-hX5gQECxT4lmUfETwCLcBGAs/s320/Fingerlings.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />High amount of waste in fish ponds degrades water quality and should be minimised as much as possible.<br /><br />Secondly, catfish are carnivorous by nature, which means they feed on flesh. So one should ensure that when stocking fingerlings, they should be sorted weekly and fingerlings of the same size should be stocked together.<br /><br />Again, fingerlings of similar sizes should be stocked into smaller tanks before transferring them to the main grow-out pond.<br /><br />Overfeeding fingerlings and juveniles may also lead to high mortality rates because they have uncontrollable appetite which lead to overfeeding and consequently death.<br /><br />Another reason is transfer stress, when they are transferred from one location to another, such fingerlings/ juveniles should be left for at least 24hours before feeding.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

I sincerely appreciate that move sir and I thank you most profoundly for it,” he said.<br /><br />The minister, in response, affirmed that, as a country, Nigeria made some serious mistakes for nearly 30 years, becoming a nation of importers.

    "content": "<br />Governor Umaru Tanko Al-Makura of Nasarawa State has constructed and handed over a modern rice processing plant to rice millers in Lafia to boost rice production in the state.<br /><br />Speaking during the handover Governor Al-Makura said the plant was established in partnership with the Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA) under the Rice Post-Harvest Processing and Marketing Pilot Project (RIPMAPP).<br /><br />The governor said the partnership under the five-year project entailed JICA providing the machines and technical expertise, while the state government provided the structures and other facilities at the plant.<br /><br />Al-Makura said the commencement of the project was delayed because of the efforts of the state government to ensure that the initiative was not misused, thereby frustrating its goals.<br /><br />Al-Makura revealed that the delay was to ensure proper registration and monitoring of the beneficiaries of the project so as to check abuse, “We do not want to go the way of previous administrations where very expensive facilities and government assets were just thrown to the dogs and people would feast on them.<br /><br />“The recent experience of `Badakoshi’ Agricultural Loan Scheme by the previous administration in the state, where farm inputs were given to farmers without concrete repayment plans, is a good lesson.<br /><br />“As we speak, Nasarawa State is indebted to the tune of about N1 billion for tractors and other inputs, which the previous administration procured and gave out free to people in the name of ‘Badakoshi’ loan scheme,” Al-Makura said.<br /><br />He explained that the government would closely monitor the rice plant to ensure its maximum utilisation by rice millers and marketers, who were given a six-month grace period to meet certain conditions.<br /><br />He noted that the government would not hesitate to take back the plant at the expiration of the grace period if the rice millers and marketers failed to satisfy the conditions.<br /><br />“The state government is committed to ensuring that our rice millers grow to the point of participating in the value chain and creating wealth for themselves and by extension the state,” he said.<br /><br />Al-Makura pledged to provide more land and other social amenities for the plant to facilitate the relocation of rice millers from their current site in Lafia to the new site.<br /><br />“The current rice mill in the Kilema area of Lafia is so choked up and the activities of millers are polluting the major water source to the Lafia waterworks, hence the need to relocate the mill to a bigger place with better facilities,’’ he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAm0/5NJJ366GNgYifYf1qVv72Oj0kkoMbVPwwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"182\" data-original-width=\"278\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAm0/5NJJ366GNgYifYf1qVv72Oj0kkoMbVPwwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;The governor also promised to provide the necessary support to the millers, adding that his administration would regularly give financial assistance to the rice millers to enable them to enhance their production.<br /><br />On his part,&nbsp; the Chairman of Nasarawa State Rice Millers and Dealers Association, Alhaji Adamu Ibrahim, thanked the state government and JICA for the project and promised that the plant would be used to boost rice production in the state.<br /><br />He appealed to the government to provide access roads, electricity and water supply facilities at the plant site to facilitate hitch free relocation of the millers.<br /><br /><b>By Hassan Ibrahim,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Addressing GMOs’ Promise, Problems",
    "content": "The debate over the promise and problems of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) has continued to rage.<br /><br />GMO has become a controversial topic as its benefits for both food producers and consumers are companied by potential biomedical risks and environmental side effects. Increasing concerns from the public about GMO, particularly in the form of genetic modified (GM) foods, are aimed at the short- and long-lasting health problems that may result from this advanced biotechnology. Complex studies are being carried out around the world independently to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of GM foods.<br /><br />The debates over GM foods focus mostly on uncertainties concerning the potential adverse effects of GM foods on human health and environmental safety. The anxiety among consumers can be attributed to four sources: the difficulty of the scientific community in explaining concisely to the lay public the biological techniques involved; concerns about the improper dissemination of GM foods; and the ethical principles inherent in traditional food processing; the misgivings with regards to the adequacy of evaluation of the GM foods.<br /><br />Three major health risks potentially associated with GM foods are: toxicity, allergenicity and genetic hazards. These arise from three potential sources, the inserted gene and their expressed proteins per se, secondary or pleiotropic effects of the products of gene expression, and the possible disruption of natural genes in the manipulated organism.<br /><br />For one thing, the unequivocal declaration that all GM crops are safe flies in the face of the World Health Organization’s (WHO’s) assertion that “it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods.” As the WHO noted, because “different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways” it is necessary to assess them “on a case-by-case basis.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KglrsA6crDE/Wh_AiN806WI/AAAAAAAAA4I/bOq3tHP74ZU0sIdwYPg7M03KOgWgykAMgCLcBGAs/s1600/GMO.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"676\" data-original-width=\"1200\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KglrsA6crDE/Wh_AiN806WI/AAAAAAAAA4I/bOq3tHP74ZU0sIdwYPg7M03KOgWgykAMgCLcBGAs/s320/GMO.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />To domesticate and address the concerns about the safety of GMOs, the Federal Government has established the National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) under the Federal Ministry of Science and Technology (FMST) and the National Biosafety Management Agency (NBMA).<br /><br />The NBMA was established by the National Biosafety Management Agency Act 2015, to provide regulatory framework to adequately safe guard human health and the environment from potential adverse effects of modern biotechnology and genetically modified organisms, while harnessing the potentials of modern biotechnology and its derivatives, for the benefit of Nigerians.<br /><br />Assistant Director/Country Coordinator, Open Forum on Agriculture Biotechnology in Africa (OFAB) Nigeria Chapter, Dr. Rose Maxwell Gidado, told The Guardian unequivocally: “The WHO has given the final verdict that ‘no effects on human health have been shown as a result of the consumption of GM foods by the general population in the countries where they have been approved.’”<br /><br />Gidado during a courtesy visit to The Guardian, in company of the Regional Director, African Agricultural Technology Foundation (AATF) Abuja, West Africa, Dr. Abdou Rhamane Issoufou Kollo, concluded: “Any quest to prove beyond doubt that GMOs are safe will run into the same roadblock, as nothing can be proven 100 per cent safe. More than 2,000 studies and 20 plus years of consumption by humans and animals have produced no evidence that GMOs represent an unusual health risk. Every major health and regulatory body in the world agrees. Critics are left holding out the argument that there is unknown threats lurking in the shadows of our future.”<br /><br />AATF is a not-for-profit organisation that facilitates and promotes public/private partnerships for the access and delivery of appropriate agricultural technologies for sustainable use by smallholder farmers in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA) through innovative partnerships and effective stewardship along the entire value chain.<br /><br />Kollo told The Guardian: “In Africa, resistance to GMO crops is strong. Organized groups supported by Europeans’ Non Governmental Organisations (NGOs) mostly cause it. These groups appear very dynamic. Excited by two recent contradictory events about GM crops in West Africa – the decision of the Government of Burkina Faso to stop growing Bt-cotton; and the decision of the Nigerian Government to authorize its cropping- the Anti-GMO proponents became hyperactive; they have been organizing concerts, radio talk shows, workshops and conferences. Their methods consist of creating confusion about GMOs and scaring the uninformed public of the supposed dangers of GM crops. Thus, mineral fertilizers, pesticides, hybrids and GMOs are often lumped together. It is appears that some of the anti-GMO proponents are organic farming crusaders who want to impose their views on the society.”<br /><br />Gidado and Kollo urged the media to help in educating the public of the benefits of biotechnology to the country and Africa.<br /><br />Gidado said the agency’s mandate is to ensure adequate level of protection in the field of safe transfer, handling and use of GMOs resulting from modern biotechnology that may have adverse effects on conservation. She said that there is going to be direct and indirect employment and production of high quality materials for industries regarding the emergence of NBDA in the country.<br /><br />Gidado said that modern biotechnology as a term adopted by international convention to refer to biotechnological techniques for the manipulation of genetic material and the fusion of cells beyond normal breeding barriers.<br /><br />“Biotechnology will ensure sustainable use of biodiversity, taking into account risks to human health, animals, plants and environment.”<br /><br />However, there has indeed been evidence of GMOs link to ill effects, and many studies published in peer-reviewed journals have detected ill effects to the animals that consumed a GM crop. For instance, a systematic review of the toxicological studies on GM foods that was published in 2009 concluded that the results of “most” of them indicate that the products “may cause hepatic, pancreatic, renal, and reproductive effects and may alter hematological, biochemical, and immunologic parameters the significance of which remains unknown.” It also noted that further studies were clearly needed. Another review that encompassed the additional studies that had been published up until August 2010 also provided cause for caution. It concluded that there was “equilibrium” between the research groups “suggesting” that GM crops are as safe as their non-GM counterparts and “those raising still serious concerns.”<br /><br />Between 2008 and 2014 there have been eight such reviews published in standard journals, and as a whole, they provide no grounds for unequivocally proclaiming safety. As Sheldon Krimsky, a professor at Tufts University, United States (U.S.), observed in a comprehensive examination that was also published in a peer-reviewed journal: “One cannot read these systematic reviews and conclude that the science on health effects of GMOs has been resolved within the scientific community.”<br /><br />But Gidado said: “In the three decades since the introduction of GMO crops, there have been more than 2,000 studies evaluating health and environmental aspects of genetically engineered products. The vast majority of studies have found nothing to indicate that GM foods represent a health threat. The consensus among scientists is that gene altered crops offer no more risk than those developed through conventional breeding techniques.<br /><br />“More than 275 independent science organizations from around the world have concluded that foods grown from genetically engineered seeds pose no unique health concerns.”<br /><br />She said more 110 Nobel laureates issued a joint communique in June 2012, stating: “Scientific and regulatory agencies around the world have repeatedly and consistently found crops and foods improved through biotechnology to be as safe as, if not safer than those derived from any other method of production.”<br /><br />According to Gidado, after a two-year evaluation, in the most comprehensive evaluation of GM crops ever undertaken, the US National Academy of Sciences concluded that genetically engineered crops have not caused increases in cancer, obesity, gastrointestinal illnesses, kidney disease, autism or allergies: there are “no differences that would implicate a higher risk to human health from eating GE foods than from eating their non-GE counterparts.”<br /><br />Gidado and Kollo dismissed a long-term study that yielded disturbing results. In it, a team of university researchers led by Gilles-Eric Séralini demonstrated that a GM crop approved by regulators based on a medium-term, 90-day toxicological feeding study caused significant damage to the rats’ livers and kidneys when tested over the long-term (two years).<br /><br />Those results cast doubt on the entire GM food venture because no regulators require tests greater than 90 days, and several GM crops have entered the market without any toxicological testing at all.<br /><br />So when the study was published in a respected journal in 2012, proponents of GM crops bitterly denounced it and demanded its retraction. But because it was a solid toxicological study, they could not attack it on that ground. So they focused on the part of the study that reported an increased rate of tumour development in the GM-fed rats, and they argued that too few animals had been used to meet the standards for a carcinogenicity study.<br /><br /><b>However, they disregarded several crucial facts:</b><br />(1) The research was not designed to meet the standards of a carcinogenicity study.<br />(2) It did fulfill the standards for a toxicological study.<br />(3) The troubling toxicological results were reliable.<br />(4) Tumours are supposed to be reported when detected during a toxicological study.<br /><br />Nonetheless, despite the weakness of their claims, they continued to pressure the journal until, more than a year after publication — and after the addition of a former Monsanto employee to the editorial board — the study was finally retracted. But not only did the chief editor acknowledge the adequacy of the toxicological findings, the lone reason he proffered for rejecting the tumour-related findings was that they were “inconclusive,” which is not a valid reason for retraction. Furthermore, according to standard guidelines, even if there had been good grounds for retracting that part of the study, the remainder should not have been withdrawn along with it.<br /><br /><b>By Chukwuma Muanya,</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Sesame Farming Suffers as Katsina Farmers Turn to High Profit Crops",
    "content": "<br />Sesame farming has suffered setback this year in Katsina State as farmers in the state are gradually switching over to the cultivation of food crops for better revenue and food security.<br /><br />In the last three years, there was growing cultivation of sesame in the state, especially in Mai’Adua, Zango, Batsari, Jibia, Charanchi and Kaita LGAs, but with the hike in the prices of food crops, farmers were seen cultivating crops like sorghum, millet, beans and maize.<br /><br />A farmer in Jibia, Umar Saminu, told this reporter that sesame was only an alternative when crops like millet and sorghum depreciated in their market value.<br /><br />“The high cost of food items experienced in the last two years has taught us a lesson hence, we abandoned sesame this year. Considering their yields it is more profitable to farm sorghum or millet than sesame,” said Saminu.<br /><br />He further explained that sesame dealers and their agents benefited more than the farmers as they bought in measures and sold in kilos.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SFao2tdtpxk/Wh11FdG7-RI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/YBsgd4GXKjYmoOlIcWCBg4wTpMyCTY6WACLcBGAs/s1600/Sesame.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-SFao2tdtpxk/Wh11FdG7-RI/AAAAAAAAA3Y/YBsgd4GXKjYmoOlIcWCBg4wTpMyCTY6WACLcBGAs/s320/Sesame.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“They buy sesame from us at the rate of not more than N600 per measure, depending on the variety of the produce and we learnt that they are selling the same produce to the export companies at about N400 per kg. If we produce food crops such as sorghum and millet we sell them in the markets directly to the buyers without hindrance,” Saminu added.<br /><br />In his reaction, a sesame dealer in Katsina, Alhaji Abdulkadir Ahmad Bado, said contrary to the perception of many sesame farmers, the dealers run at higher risks than them considering how the price of the produce fluctuates in the world market.<br /><br />“Farmers that sell their produce at N580 - N600 per measure are better off than us who sell per kg. Remember we follow them to their doorsteps to buy the sesame&nbsp; and we incur all the packaging and transportation expenses before selling it at between N306 and N312 per kg in Kano. With 55 measures equivalent to 105 - 107Kgs, the best one can make is N33,384 while the farmer made N31,900 out of the same measures,” he explained.<br /><br />He added that the dwindling price and short supply of the produce has chased many dealers out of the business.<br /><br />Daily Trust on Sunday observed that this year, sesame was partly cultivated in Musawa, Matazu, Kankiya and Dutsin-Ma LGAs and investigation by this reporter revealed that its farmers wanted to take advantage of the produce’s scarcity as farmers concentrated in producing food crops.<br /><br />One of the farmers in Matazu&nbsp; LGA, Malam Shu’aibu Gyaza, said those that produced maize, sorghum or millet were making more money than them.<br /><br />“In a wrong calculation, we expected the price of food crops to crash as they were massively produced; that was why we were into sesame. The clever ones among us cultivated it alongside sorghum and beans to counter any risk,” Gyaza noted.<br /><br />He added that there is possibility for the demand of the produce to rise over its short supply in the state this year.<br /><br />Another sesame dealer, Alhaji Lawal Magaji Bumbum, said government and agric companies needed to invest in the production of the produce in the state.<br /><br />“As one of the highly sought after cash crops in Nigeria, Katsina State has to explore its potentialities in producing the crop through provision of improved seeds and other inputs to farmers while companies and other entrepreneurs should invest in its value chain.<br /><br />“Farmers should concentrate on the provision of organic manure to their farmlands for the improvement of soil fecundity,” he also advised.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmud,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "NIRSAL Has Solution to Herdsmen/farmers Clashes — Abdulhameed",
    "content": "<br />Bureau Chief ABUJA—The Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending, NIRSAL, has the solution to the debilitating clashes between herdsmen and crop farmers across the nation.<br /><br />The Managing Director of NIRSAL, Mr. Aliyu Abdulhameed, said this in Abuja. NIRSAL recently sealed agricultural financing deals with Stanbic/IBTC and Union Banks worth N20 billion.&nbsp; Each of the two banks has made available N10 billion to boost the nation’s agri-business value chain. According to him, once appropriate ranches are created for the herders to keep their cattle in the same place and feed them well enough, the clashes would be eliminated.<br /><br />He said that ranching would also guarantee high milk production and that the cows would grow fatter, which would translate to more meat and more money for cattle owners, as well as, greater contributions to the nation’s Gross Domestic Product, GDP. He said: “NIRSAL has the solution to the clashes between herdsmen and crop farmers.&nbsp;<br /><br />The clashes are because of the herders’ nomadic lives.&nbsp; Put them in a location; do a basic feed finishing, put them in one place.&nbsp; Let them eat, drink, sleep and put on weight.&nbsp; That weight is money for us. If they eat and walk around, they waste the energy and don’t put on weight.&nbsp; They lose weight.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsYrfhPB6AU/WfBMaJlQDsI/AAAAAAAAAi4/uw7Bsj6UU78Wys2-qVEZLquG9U7ZwsnPACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Cattle-Herdsmen.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"720\" data-original-width=\"1280\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-EsYrfhPB6AU/WfBMaJlQDsI/AAAAAAAAAi4/uw7Bsj6UU78Wys2-qVEZLquG9U7ZwsnPACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Cattle-Herdsmen.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“If we can do feed finishing for cattle, for example, on annual basis, that N10 billion from Union Bank will result in about 160, 000 bulls being fattened, 16, 000 direct jobs, will be created and 80, 000 lives that will depend on those 16, 000 direct jobs will be affected.&nbsp; I hope everyone has understood what that N10 billion means to agriculture.”<br /><br />Feeding 180m Nigerians big business- Emuwa While signing the deal, the Group Managing Director (GMD) of Union Bank Plc, Mr. Emeka Emuwa, said that the decision to invest the N10 billion into agricultural financing was based on the bank’s conviction that there huge opportunities inherent in the nation’s agric-business.<br /><br />According to him, feeding 180 million Nigerians alone present great business opportunities and that his organization was prepared to invest, even more in the sector, once the initial investment had good returns. He said, “If you think of Nigeria, we are 180 million people.<br /><br />That tells you the scope of opportunities that exist.&nbsp; I think we have a large capacity to feed ourselves and we have to.&nbsp; What we are doing today is part of efforts to feed ourselves.&nbsp; If we feed ourselves, we create opportunities for ourselves, as well.<br /><br />“In the past, there had been times, when it was felt that lending to agriculture, you couldn’t see what you were putting your money into.&nbsp; Part of the role of NIRSAL is to shine the light so that we can all see where we are putting our money into. “Agriculture is the engine that drives many Africa economies.&nbsp; It is the largest employer of labour in&nbsp; African economies, employing about 65 per cent of the population.&nbsp;<br /><br />A lot of people depend on agriculture.&nbsp; It is therefore, in our interest to make sure that agriculture continues to do well. “One of the major challenges of agriculture is funding.&nbsp; It is improving but still remains a challenge.&nbsp; It is in response to that that we have are launching this partnership with NIRSAL.&nbsp; This partnership is the beginning.&nbsp; We expect that as it evolves the more that we see that the outcome of this partnership is positive, the more we will be willing and able to expand the size of this partnership.<br /><br />“Our focus will be enhancing post-production, processing capacity to curb post-harvest losses and to provide market access to small–holder farmers, which in itself, has been a limiting factor. Farmers are producing but not able to get their produce to the market is one of the things that we seek to support.” The GMD added that with NIRSAL taking off 75 per cent risk in the deal, he was convinced that Nigerian businesses that would benefit from the funding would easily make good use of the facilities to be placed at their disposal.<br /><b><br /></b><b>By Emma Ujah,</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

There is more good news to report,” Mohammed said.<br /><br />The minister attributed the improvement in rice production across the country to government’s Anchor Borrowers’<br />Programme initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari, which supports farmers through inputs distribution and loans to boost rice production.<br /><br />Presently there are 12.2 million nigerians cultivating rice according to the Rice Farmers Association of Nigeria (RIFAN).<br /><br /><b>By: Olawale Ajimotokan</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Foreigners Taking Over Nigeria’s Agric Sector, Says FG",
    "content": "<br />Foreigners are currently taking over Nigeria’s agricultural sector as a result of the excessively high interest rates being demanded from indigenous agriculturists by Deposit Money Banks, the Federal Government has said.<br /><br />It also stated that the production and sale of crude oil could not salvage the country’s fragile economy, adding that revenue generation from oil was too low when compared to what some smaller countries were making from agro exports.<br /><br />Speaking on the sidelines of a seminar organised in Abuja by the Danish Embassy in Nigeria on value development in the country’s food and agriculture sector, the Minister of State for Agriculture and Rural Development, Senator Heineken Lokpobiri, said the major challenge inhibiting the desired development of the country’s agricultural sector was poor access to finance.<br /><br />Lokpobiri stated, “The major challenge bedevilling this industry is access to finance. Agricultural financing in Nigeria is too costly; for even at nine per cent you can’t find it. They will ask you for all forms of collateral, the CBN will say bring your father’s house, bring this, bring that.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N3NudGtPr8E/Wh0ZiNaWQZI/AAAAAAAAA2w/OIhYmhEwtA4J5oMbdEPU71MSbQRuEJq3gCLcBGAs/s1600/MSAN.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"174\" data-original-width=\"289\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N3NudGtPr8E/Wh0ZiNaWQZI/AAAAAAAAA2w/OIhYmhEwtA4J5oMbdEPU71MSbQRuEJq3gCLcBGAs/s1600/MSAN.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“But if you have a company that is ready to support agro investors, then people will invest. If you have access to cheap funds, you will be able to invest on a long term basis. Instead of getting a loan from a commercial bank at 25 to 30 per cent, you can have it at two per cent and pay back in about 30 years. Here, you don’t have such funding. That is what we are talking about.<br /><br />“And that is why if you look at it now, foreigners are taking over the agro sector here; either from India, they get it (loan) at three or four per cent, or from Europe at two or three per cent. But here, it is 30 per cent and they (banks) are not even willing to give. The only way you can compete with others is for you to have cheap funds that will reduce your production costs.”<br /><br />Lokpobiri explained that the economic system being run in Nigeria over the years had made it possible for the banking sector to hold the country hostage with high interest rates, adding that this was why the government often borrowed less from the domestic market.<br /><br />He said countries that invested in agriculture earned far better than Nigeria, adding that oil production would not salvage the country’s economy.<br /><br />The minister added, “Nigerians shouldn’t think that we have oil and that oil is going to salvage this country. Countries that are investing in agriculture are getting much more profits than what we get from oil. Do we even get up to $30bn from oil? That is the point.<br /><br />“Denmark, with a population of about five million people and less land mass than Nigeria, has a net agro export worth over €80bn. Now, ask yourself this question, how many billion dollars do we get from oil export? This clearly shows that there is more profit in agro investment than even in oil investment.”<br /><br /><b>By: Okechukwu Nnodim,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Poultry Sector As Metaphor for our Problems – Dele Sobowale",
    "content": "<br /><i>Governing Italians is not impossible; it is merely useless.” Benito Mussolini, 1883-1945. Italian Fascist leader.&nbsp;</i><br /><br />Mussolini was fortunate; he had Italians to govern and not Nigerians. He would have shot himself long before his enemies got him, if he had my countrymen as subjects. There is probably no nation on earth where the people are the worst enemy the government has to face as Nigeria. Indeed, it might be right to claim that no external enemy can attack Nigeria and inherit the confusion and the lack of patriotism.<br /><br />Integrated poultry On Wednesday, November 8, 2017, one of the leading national newspapers published a report which brought tears to my eyes. It was titled “N2.5Bn Chickens Wasting Away In Cold Rooms.” The immediate past President of the Poultry Association of Nigeria, PAN, Dr Ayoola Oduntan, reportedly announced at the Nigerian Poultry Show tagged ‘Abeokuta 2017’ that “N2.5bn worth of frozen chicken is wasting away in cold rooms all over Nigeria, produced in Nigeria by Nigerian farmers; while the people that are smuggling in chickens are feeding fat from the joblessness of our people.”<br /><br />A few months ago, the same poultry sector had lamented the glut of eggs in the Nigerian market resulting in massive losses for farmers. Altogether, Nigerians are deliberately or inadvertently working to dismantle our poultry industry. To start with, N2.5 billion worth of chickens is not a lot of birds. At N2000 per bird, we are talking of a little over one million birds in total.<br /><br />Despite our low per capita consumption of chicken, by global standards, still with a population of 180 million people, one million chicken should just about be sufficient for two weeks or at worst a month.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OmqVgooEF8k/WeGhizvoEtI/AAAAAAAAAXg/TIuF-vaBKYgfdcKdnpBso2U0YfKrrzYyQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Poultry.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"406\" data-original-width=\"760\" height=\"170\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OmqVgooEF8k/WeGhizvoEtI/AAAAAAAAAXg/TIuF-vaBKYgfdcKdnpBso2U0YfKrrzYyQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Poultry.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><b><br /></b><b>So, why are they wasting away in cold rooms?&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Three reasons account for the situation and they all point to Nigerians not doing what we should be doing to save our economy. In fact, Buhari might on occasions be wondering if governing Nigerians is not useless.<br /><br />The solution to this problem lies in our hands – consumers, investors and governments. Governments include all state governments. If the reader is one of those buying imported chicken from the open market or from the leading supermarkets, then, you are the major part of the problem. Let me explain. If every Nigerian insists on buying only chicken grown in Nigeria, one million birds per week will<br />not be sufficient for our needs.<br /><br />Each of us can help the situation by simply refusing to patronize imported chicken whether smuggled or not. We can collectively turn the poultry sector into a job creating machine for rapid economic growth and lasting development because it has a lot of linkages which space will not permit me to address. To help the situation, we should all just stop buying imported chicken and encourage as many people as possible to do the same.<br /><br />The result will be astonishing. Once smugglers are deprived of markets the supply will dry up. Smuggling thrives only as long as there are customers for the product. Years ago smuggling lace was popular. The poultry producers themselves should not assume they are totally helpless. In every situation, those under attack will repel the invasion if they also undertake self-defence. Smugglers, big and small, and their distribution channels are not peopled by ghosts; neither are the major intermediaries who bring the products to the ultimate consumers totally unknown or impossible to track down and identify.<br /><br />PAN should be prepared to tax its members to establish a team of investigators who will be charged with tracking the smugglers and mapping their distribution channels. Then, a series of sting operation with Nigeria Customs Service, NCS, will have to be carried out to gradually close the channels and penalize the owners. It has been done before and it can be repeated several times until the smugglers and their collaborators get the message that there is no market for smuggled chicken in Nigeria.<br /><br />However, neither consumer resistance nor investors measures will deter smuggling of poultry products until the Nigeria governments – all thirty-seven of them — develop a policy of “No tolerance for Smuggled Chicken” in any state of Nigeria. Just as it required monumental global effort to eradicate polio, Nigerians, led by governments, must develop the will to stamp out smuggled chicken from the country. It might call for the creation of a task force whose members include NCS, Police, PAN and civil society advocates.<br /><br />Like NAFDAC fighting fake drugs, they should be charged with ridding the country of smuggled chicken just as we are now on the verge of eradicating polio. The first and most important step for them is to map the entire country to determine the major destination points for smuggled chicken and the network of distributors, wholesalers and retailers. It requires no rocket science intelligence to know that Lagos, Abuja, Portharcourt, Kano, Kaduna, Warri, Calabar, Onitsha, Asaba etc will constitute the major markets.<br /><br />Neither does it call for much wisdom to guess that the fast food outlets and big hotels might be some of the biggest customers of the&nbsp; smugglers. The first step is identification of the criminals and from there the battle plan can be developed. It has been done before and it can be successful if all the parties are fully committed to it.&nbsp; &nbsp; There is no alternative to saving our poultry sector. It is “do or die” affair.<br /><br /><b>By Dele Sobowale&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Customs Boss, Commends Ogbeh on Agric Training for Officers",
    "content": "The Comptroller General of Nigeria Customs Service, Col Hameed Ali(retd), had lauded the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh for organising agricultural training for officer and men of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) Describing agricultural sector as having a pre-eminent role in boosting Nigeria’s economy, Ali noted this when he led a team of senior officers of his command on a visit to Ogbeh, in Abuja, at the week end.<br /><br />Ali, who pledged the continued work of Customs “to protect this country” and to ensure that the minister’s passion succeeds, also explained that “our major contribution is to ensure that we can reduce to the barest minimum the importation of rice” so that the rice that is grown here is sold.<br /><br />According to Ali, curbing the “Importation of things like poultry, prohibited from our own country as illicit items is our primary mandate and we going to continue to do it diligently to ensure that our own economy improves and we are able to feed not only ourselves, but the whole of Africa and the whole world.”<br /><br />“Let me underscore the importance of your ministry, Ali said, acknowledging that “one of the very innovative steps” the minister took was “to sensitise government officials on the importance of agriculture.” He thanked Winnie Ochinyabo “for championing the cause of this sensitisation. We’ve had a very good session with her at the Customs’ headquarters. I sincerely appreciate that move sir and I thank you most profoundly for that.” According to the Customs boss, “the privilege we have had to listen to what has happened has generated the interest of virtually everybody that was there to now look towards agriculture.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T574D_mIyhQ/WhvstnpCjPI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/L9srKzKhMHk3ZMXP2D4lPP1GTXgvDmergCLcBGAs/s1600/Ogbeh.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"462\" data-original-width=\"696\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T574D_mIyhQ/WhvstnpCjPI/AAAAAAAAA2Q/L9srKzKhMHk3ZMXP2D4lPP1GTXgvDmergCLcBGAs/s320/Ogbeh.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />That same opportunity should be given to our own people that are outside Abuja.” He therefore requested for visits to Customs officers at their zonal offices. Reflecting on the increasing passion for agriculture by officers of the Customs services, Ali acknowledged that, on “the little that we have been able to talk to them when they came for the meeting, everybody has expressed interest.”<br /><br />He drew attention to the increasing number of hitherto poor farmers who paid for hajj operation. The minister, in response, affirmed that, as a country, Nigeria “made some serious mistakes for nearly thirty years, becoming a nation of importers. No country ever became strong by being totally import-dependent. And no country is strong without being able to feed itself.” He expressed solidarity with the Customs men, saying, they “are taking the risk of protecting our border,” and, in the process, many of them “get killed by ruthless smugglers.”<br /><br />“I congratulate you for what you’ve helped us do with rice between September 2015 and now. The report from the Thai rice exporters’ association, not our own report, says that rice export to Nigeria has dropped from 644,000 tons to 20,000 tons officially,” the minister said, attributing much of this reduction in rice imports and smuggling to the efforts of the Customs officials. “So. let me thank you and your men because it’s a very dangerous job trying to stop these people. They are strong and they carry weapons of all kinds”, he added.<br /><br />Ogbeh commended the way the Customs men “are invading warehouse now, seizing the things,” urging them to “please continue,” as Nigeria has a record 12.2 million people growing rice now, according to RIFAN, the Rice Farmers’ Association. He advised the Customs officials to “get involved, as Schedule Five of the Nigerian constitution allows you to farm. He promised that, “we will be around to help you because, agriculture should really become a national culture; and it should never ever again disappear.<br /><br /><b>By Ganiyu Obaaro&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Times News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

After an aggressive campaign for rice farming in the country, spearheaded by Buhari’s government over the past 2 years, rice has become abundant reducing Nigeria’s rice importation drastically.<br /><br />Addressing a press conference in Abuja, the Minister of Information and Culture, Lai Mohammed while quoting figures from the Thailand Rice Exporters Association, said rice importation from Thailand dropped from 644,131 Metric Tonnes to about 21,000 MT between September 2015 and September 2017.

According to Mohammed some investors from Thailand have even shown interest in establishing rice milling plants in Nigeria.<br /><br />“A few years ago, this would not have been possible since Nigeria was not considered a top rice producing country.<br /><br />Today, Nigeria is one of the largest producers of rice,” he said. Meanwhile a food price survey across select markets in Lagos by Bounce News also revealed that the price of the commodity is on a downward spiral.<br /><br />A 50kg bag of rice which sold for between 16,500 and 15,000 from September towards mid-October now goes for 14,000 naira. However, it is still far from the 8,500 naira that the commodity sold before the end of 2015.<br /><br /><b>Source: Daily Times News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Considered the “Nobel Prize for Agriculture,” the World Food Prize is awarded each year for a specific and exceptionally significant contribution to the production and distribution of food. This year, the prize was awarded to Dr. Akinwumi&nbsp; Adesina, a former Nigerian Agriculture Minister and currently the president of the African Development Bank (AfDB) for his contributions to increasing productivity in the country’s agricultural sector.<br /><br />A list of Adesina’s achievements as Minister of Agriculture from 2010 to 2015 spans several pages. But for the World Food Prize, the focal point was his introduction of the Electronic Wallet (E-Wallet) platform to Nigeria’s food production and distribution chain.<br /><br />Through the E-Wallet, Adesina pioneered a new way for the Nigerian government to deliver subsidized farm inputs, such as fertilizer and seeds, to local farmers through private agro-dealers. The farmers, in turn, get to redeem these subsidized inputs from the agro-dealers using e-vouchers, which they can access through their mobile phones.<br /><br />To implement the platform, Adesina initiated a Growth and Enhancement Support Scheme (GES). He powered the scheme by orchestrating the successful registration of more than 15 million Nigerian farmers, whose information and mobile phone numbers were added to the GES database. The database, coupled with the E-Wallet, now allows Nigerian farmers to receive directly from the government everything from fertilizer to high-yield rice seeds and palm oil seedlings.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KixHxbx5IB0/WhgH7G_WIsI/AAAAAAAAA08/Za3SEJCtAIoLwTmFl5PaX8pUM-e-L6iCwCLcBGAs/s1600/Raccolta%2BJatropha.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KixHxbx5IB0/WhgH7G_WIsI/AAAAAAAAA08/Za3SEJCtAIoLwTmFl5PaX8pUM-e-L6iCwCLcBGAs/s1600/Raccolta%2BJatropha.jpg\" /></a></div><br />In the past, such subsidized inputs would have bypassed the farmers and fallen into the hands of black marketers who would have sold the inputs on the open market or in neighboring countries. According to the World Food Prize, through the E-wallet, Adesina succeeded in breaking the “back of corrupt elements that had controlled the fertilizer distribution system for 40 years.”<br /><br />The platform also helped solve other previously intractable problems in the way of commercial large scale food production in Nigeria.<br /><br />For example, the country’s paddy rice farmers, through the E-Wallet, were able to receive from the government award-winning, high yield NERICA rice varieties, which saw their output rise from five to six tons per hectare. Thousands of paddy farmers producing a consistent grade of rice soon created the opportunity for several agro-based companies to switch from rice importation to local rice production, and standardization of the country’s rice output led to large private sector investments in rice milling.<br /><br />The World Food Prize compares the spread of Adesina’s efforts in scale to the “Green Revolution” work of the Nobel Peace Prize winner, Norman Borlaug. In the 1970s and 1980s, Borlaug introduced high-yield dwarf wheat to Latin America and Asia, spawning “Green Revolutions” on two continents.<br /><br />As other African countries start to adopt E-Wallet platforms to get subsidized inputs – and even financial services – directly to their farmers, the World Food Prize claims Adesina’s E-Wallet is “sparking a Borlaugian ‘Take It to the Farmer’ revolution across Africa.”<br /><br />In his more recent job as president of Africa’s premier multilateral development finance institution, the AfDB, Adesina embraces the continent’s “youth bulge” both as an opportunity and a resource in working for economic transformation. Africa’s labour market is expected to absorb 11 million youths every year for the next decade. Despite rapid growth in formal wage sector jobs, the World Bank estimates that most of the continent’s young people “are likely to work on family farms and in household enterprises, often with very low incomes.”<br /><br />Adesina wants to drive Africa’s economic transformation by empowering the continent’s youth population and making agriculture the hottest startup sector for young people. To achieve this goal, he wants to change the perception of agriculture in Africa from being a survival activity to a vehicle for wealth creation; from a hobby to a business.<br /><br />It, therefore, came as no surprise when Adesina, halfway through his acceptance speech for the World Food Prize, declared to the crowded room in the American Midwestern city of Des Moines that “there will be no rest for me until Africa feeds itself, and for that we need the youth.<br /><br />“Even though I don’t have the check in my hand right now,” he continued, “I hereby commit my quarter of a million dollars… prize award to set up a fund fully dedicated to providing grants, fellowships and financing for the youth of Africa in agriculture as a business.” Adesina’s vision for Africa’s youth and agriculture becomes prescient as the world’s geopolitical winds shift the focus of policymakers.<br /><br />Britain’s Brexit vote to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States mark a rightward shift in the geopolitical landscape, with increasing numbers of countries appealing to more nationalistic agendas and responding to calls to stem immigration.<br /><br />Creating jobs for young people in agriculture can both help Africa’s economic transformation and offer a solution to some of the challenges facing the continent and the world: the high rate of youth unemployment in Africa; human trafficking and the high rate of illegal migration of young Africans into Europe; sustainably kick-starting Africa’s industrialization; and preventing religious radicalization and combating terrorism.<br /><br />Africa’s rapid population growth, specifically the growth of the working-age population, complicates a precarious labour market characterized by poor-quality employment, which in turn creates the urge for the youth to seek better opportunities elsewhere. The International Labor Organization estimates that in the next four years, an additional 12.6 million youth in sub-Saharan Africa will enter the labour force.&nbsp; Data from the International Organization for Migration reveals that more than 154,000 young Africans have crossed the Mediterranean to Europe in 2017 so far. More than 2,900 have died trying to make the crossing. In 2016, more than 352,000 Africans crossed into Europe and more than 4,750 died. Adesina, in remarks&nbsp; leading up to the 2015 Action Plan for African Agricultural Transformation conference in Dakar, pointed out that “the agricultural sector [in Africa] has four times the power to create jobs and reduce poverty than any other sector.<br /><br />“That is why we make the claim that we can diminish the migrant crisis in Europe by supporting agricultural transformation in Africa,” he said.<br /><br />In his remarks at the 2017 G7 Summit in Taormina, Italy in May, Adesina expanded on this vision when he said that “the future of Africa’s youth does not lie in migration to Europe” or should it be “at the bottom of the Mediterranean.” He proposed rather that an agribusiness-driven economy could be one of the economic reasons Africa’s youth choose to remain on the continent. “We must turn rural areas from zones of economic misery to zones of economic prosperity,” Adesina said. “This requires new agricultural innovations and transforming agriculture into a sector for creating wealth. We must make agriculture a really cool choice for young people. The future millionaires and billionaires of Africa will come initially from agriculture.”<br /><br />Industrialization has been referred to as the most effective driver of structural poverty reduction. Experts remind us that no developing country has transitioned into a developed country without industrializing.<br /><br />&nbsp; Adesina, in his opening speech at the Dakar conference, questioned the theory that assumes labour must move from the agricultural sector to the industrial sector. Rather, Adesina suggested an economic theory of industrialization that sees Africa’s industrialization starting from the agricultural sector.<br /><br />“The reality,” he said, “is that agro-industrialization has greatest potential for Africa to achieve more rapid and inclusive growth – and create jobs… If you want industrialization of Africa, and massive job creation, focus on industrializing the agriculture sector.”<br /><br />&nbsp; He went on to add, “to rapidly modernize agriculture, we must get the youth engaged in the sector. We must change the perception of the youths on agriculture—they must see agriculture as a business.”<br /><br />&nbsp; &nbsp;The Africa Centre for Strategic Studies has warned that one of the “key effects of ISIS’s continued loss of territory and operational capacity in Iraq and Syria will be an increase in the number of ISIS fighters returning to regions in Africa already facing a threat from violent Islamists.”<br /><br />Dr. Oloruntoba, Editor at All Africa Media, writes from Washington DC.<br /><br />In his opening remarks at the West African Ministerial Conference in October 2016, Adesina observed that “today, across Africa, unemployed youths are turning into gangs, getting into kidnappings for a living, getting recruited to join terrorist groups. And those are the wrong kind of jobs.”<br /><br />At his speech at the 2017 G7 conference in Italy, he referred to the deadly combination of extreme rural poverty, high youth unemployment and environmental climate degradation as the “triangle of disaster. Where these factors are found, they provide rich recruitment zones for terrorists.”<br /><br />In Adesina’s view, agribusiness – more than any other economic sector – has the power to bring wealth to the rural parts of Africa<br /><br />“I believe that the future millionaires of Africa will come from agriculture, not from the oil and gas industry. Agriculture will become Africa’s new oil.”<br /><br />Adesina has also announced that his World Food Prize money will be used to establish a World Food Prize Global Youth Institute for Africa, an organization he said will support a new generation of agricultural scientists and innovators across Africa. This organisation will nurture and produce graduates known as Borlaug-Adesina Fellows, who will become the next generation of hunger fighters.<br /><br />Dr. Oloruntoba, Editor at All Africa Medica, writes from Washington DC.<br /><br /><b>By&nbsp; Bunmi Oloruntoba</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Agriculture Can Sustain Nigerian economy — Experts",
    "content": "<br />In a bid to break the monoculture system and widen the resource base of the economy, agricultural experts have advised that Nigeria should return to agriculture fully as it can sustain the economy.<br /><br />Speaking at the 2017 Agra Innovate West Africa conference in Lagos, the President, Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mrs. Nike Akande, said that agriculture had the potential to become the most significant way to achieve economic development in Nigeria.<br /><br />Akande, who described agriculture as a very significant sector, said more attention should be paid to the industry as it could provide employment for more than 75 per cent of the unemployed population in Nigeria.<br /><br />According to her, Nigeria is endowed with the capacity to produce a variety of agricultural products if the right resources were provided to farmers.<br /><br />The President, Nigeria Agribusiness Group, Mr. Emmanuel Ijewere, stated that agriculture consists of many activities and not just farming.<br /><br />“We should all focus on agriculture because it has a lot of potential. Lagos State, for example, has the biggest food market in Africa. According to researches, Mile 12 market has been reported to generate a turnover of over N4bn per day,” he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OFFJ3mZbl7s/WhftjG50EdI/AAAAAAAAA0k/c0PPu8xHfsoGhaYfcZwhqBLnLQyzGfFtgCLcBGAs/s1600/BITN.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"424\" data-original-width=\"839\" height=\"161\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OFFJ3mZbl7s/WhftjG50EdI/AAAAAAAAA0k/c0PPu8xHfsoGhaYfcZwhqBLnLQyzGfFtgCLcBGAs/s320/BITN.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Ijewere further said that the nation’s heavy dependence on oil had negatively affected the economy, and advised the government to invest more in the agricultural sector.<br /><br />In an exclusive interview, the Executive Director, Nigerian Institute of Oceanography and Marine Research, Dr. Gbola Akande, also stated that agriculture alone was enough to sustain the Nigerian economy.<br /><br />According to him, there are countries that do not have oil, but are surviving purely as agrarian economies.<br /><br />He said, “Agriculture is the surest way of generating resources and at the same time, reducing unemployment. However, we must add value to our agricultural produce.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, the British American Tobacco Nigeria Foundation says it is supporting smallholder farmers across the country with loans, fertilisers, farmlands and irrigation systems.<br /><br />It also announced its readiness to support the initiative of the Federal Government to enhance agricultural development, poverty reduction and create successful entrepreneurs from rural farmers.<br /><br />This, it said, would ensure large-scale food production and improve the skills of farmers migrating from subsistence agriculture to commercial farming.<br /><br />The Director, BATN, Mr. Yusuf Agemi, who gave this indication at an event organised by the foundation in Abuja, said that arable farmlands, effective irrigation systems, fertilisers and financial support were being given to smallholder farmers to ease their farming methods and boost agricultural productivity in Nigeria.<br /><br />He said, “We are giving loans to smallholder farmers at an interest rate that is below single digit. Funding has been a major challenge to them; so, we are doing this in collaboration with the Federal Government, thereby increasing from their initial five hectares of land to more land space.<br /><br />“We are also focusing on cassava development, rice, maize and vegetable cultivation. We are supporting the farmers with irrigation so that they can have enough water all-year round. We are helping them to get real high quality input and high yielding grain.”<br /><br />Agemi added, “The support also includes providing them with the right quality fertilisers for their inputs, as well as helping them in clearing the land using tractors. This year alone, we have developed modern enterprise farms to train farmers on modern ways of farming.”<br /><br />In her address, the Chairman, NEPAD Business Group Nigeria, Mrs. Nike Akande, said it was important to develop the value chain in collaboration with private sector operators, in order to ensure climate change consideration.<br /><br />She said, “More than half of the nation’s population live in rural areas and are mostly peasant farmers. Therefore, adequate attention should be shifted to agriculture, especially efforts that will enhance the economic fortunes of the rural and smallholder farmers, because this can positively turn the economy of the nation around.<br /><br />“However, this cannot be achieved without the development of the value chain components for our agricultural produce. So, the private sector is critical to the development of the desired value chain component for our agricultural products. It is the private sector that will drive the process and government must create conducive environment.”<br /><br /><b>By: Okechukwu Nnodim and Feyisayo Popoola</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Bumper Cotton Harvest in Katsina, Price Rises in Markets",
    "content": "<br />Cotton farmers in Katsina State have recorded bumper harvest this season. They are also having better prices for their produce compared to last year.<br /><br />Previously, poor quality seeds, which result in low yield as well as poor market prices have made many farmers to abandon cotton cultivation in the state leaving only a few in the business.<br /><br />Alhaji Kamilu Kankara, a large scale farmer and cotton dealer, told Daily Trust that cotton farming has significantly declined in recent years due to what farmers term as poor seeds as the crop was not giving them high yield as expected.<br /><br />“God so kind, the few that cultivated the crop this year have a different story to tell as they recorded a bumper harvest. For example, in a farmland of a little over a hectare, I harvested 53 bags of cotton in the first pick, which I sold at N165,000 per ton,” he said.<br /><br />He added that the price of cotton began to appreciate from last year with a ton of the produce rising to N80,000 and peaked at N300,000, adding that the price started at N120,000 per ton this year and is still rising.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_-80bmt8f3A/WhbeIncQcOI/AAAAAAAAA0U/gB23NQ26Zygj_OV1HIjLfFPKqJJp00XqQCLcBGAs/s1600/Cotton%2BPlantation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_-80bmt8f3A/WhbeIncQcOI/AAAAAAAAA0U/gB23NQ26Zygj_OV1HIjLfFPKqJJp00XqQCLcBGAs/s320/Cotton%2BPlantation.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Alhaji Kamilu said cotton has given him the highest income; more than maize this year.<br /><br />“Many are of the belief that it is more profitable to cultivate maize than cotton but not this year. I harvested two tons of cotton from a farm that used to give me 40 bags of maize; and with the market price of maize at N8,000 per bag, I would have earned only N320,000 instead of N330,000 that I got from the two tons of cotton,” he explained.<br /><br />A cotton farmer at Yar-goje, Malam Sani Abdullahi, expressed optimism that cotton farming has high prospect in the near future as the price was fast improving.<br /><br />“The fact is that many of us have completely lost faith in cotton farming, that is why its production keeps slimming every year but with the recent significant improvement in its market price, the production of the crop has high prospects.<br /><br />“Farming nowadays is profit-driven, even among subsistence farmers, and when farmers realized that they can earn more from cotton than maize, sorghum or soybeans, certainly many will shift to its cultivation,” he added.<br /><br />He added that revival of the local textile industries was the cornerstone of cotton production in the country as farmers cannot rely on international market alone to sell their produce.<br /><br />Alhaji Sagir Malumfashi, a cotton dealer, told this reporter that international companies were yet to fully start buying the produce but due to its high price last year, many local entrepreneurs have now flooded the market to hoard the produce.<br /><br />“There is likelihood of cotton scarcity in the state this year as only few farmers produce it. Because of this, entrepreneurs are rushing to stockpile the produce even before the international companies start buying,” he said.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmud,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Wheat Farmers Struggle for Improved Seeds as Planting Begins",
    "content": "<br />The National Chairman of Wheat Farmers Association of Nigeria (WFAN), Salim Muhammad, has said that certified high yielding wheat seeds are not readily accessible to wheat farmers in the country. This, he said, is a major constraint facing his members who want to cultivate.<br /><br />In an interview with Daily Trust, Muhammed said wheat seeds currently used in the wheat producing states are foundation seeds. He said no company in the country produces certified wheat seeds.<br /><br />His concern is coming as planting season begins this month.<br /><br />He also said for the past two production seasons, wheat farmers have not received any support from the Federal Ministry of Agriculture nor the states’ ministries of agriculture - except for few states like Kebbi, Kano and Jigawa whose governments support wheat production.<br /><br />He, however, said his association has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Flour Mill Association of Nigeria (FMAN) which, he said, has promised to supply them with threshing machines before the end of the harvest period this year.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gu7YqobgMZ4/WhbaJBUIEzI/AAAAAAAAAz8/KOLw4eHmXFEuxbKiJzcPPX4_JuUs92HqwCLcBGAs/s1600/Wheat%2BGrains.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Gu7YqobgMZ4/WhbaJBUIEzI/AAAAAAAAAz8/KOLw4eHmXFEuxbKiJzcPPX4_JuUs92HqwCLcBGAs/s320/Wheat%2BGrains.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />This, he said, is in addition to 2,000 units of 50kg bags of wheat seeds his association received from FMAN for distribution to farmers in the seven wheat producing states of the country.<br /><br />Muhammad said with the commencement of farming season, the distribution of seeds to, especially first time wheat farmers, across producing states has also commenced. He added that farmers that have been into its production have saved seeds of at least 100kg bag which they were earlier advised to save in order to continue production.<br /><br />Although there are numerous challenges facing the sector, Mohammad was however delighted about the expected yield and an appreciative increase in the area under wheat cultivation from last farming season compared to this year’s.<br /><br />“We are expecting an increase over the production of last season from 20 per cent and above. Because last season, as you are aware, we cultivated about 300,000ha and our target this season is 500,000ha,” he said.<br /><br />Muhammad further lamented that because of lack of mechanisation, many wheat farmers only practiced it on subsistence level using traditional farm tools which is highly labour intensive.<br /><br />“Our farmers are left using traditional subsistence farming. We are advocating that government assists farmers in migrating from subsistence farming to a level of at least semi-mechanised farming. That would definitely improve the yield production output, cut the cost of production and consumers of the end product would get the commodity at a very reasonable price,” he said.<br /><br />He identified ready market as another major challenge to wheat producers in the country but expressed optimism with the newly signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between his association and the Flour Mill Association of Nigeria.<br /><br />The MoU, he said, would ensure that all the excess wheat produced in the country is bought by FMAN at a guaranteed minimum price favourable to both parties.<br /><br />At present, Daily Trust reports that 100kg of wheat is sold at between N19,000 and N22,000 in the markets, especially in the wheat producing states.<br /><br />In Katsina, 100kg of wheat is sold for between N20,000 and N21,000 while in Kano State it is sold for N18,000 and N19,000 depending on the market. It is also within the same range in Jigawa and Kebbi states.<br /><br />The chairman of the wheat farmers also confirmed to Daily Trust that the price of the produce has crashed from N35,000 last year to about N18,000 to N20,000 this year.<br /><br />He said the price is poor but accommodating as farmers would not run at a loss considering the economic cost of production per hectare.<br /><br />The chairman, who identified late planting and poor quality seed as main reasons why some areas record poor harvests, also stressed the need to fund researches to develop higher yielding varieties.<br /><br />“Up to now, the seeds that we are sowing only yield 4 tonnes to 5 tonnes per hectare, while countries like India are producing 8 tonnes to 10 tonnes per hectare. There is no seed company in Nigeria that can tell you I have 10 bags of certified wheat seeds, we are still using foundation seeds as material to plant,” he added.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigeria to Achieve Self-sufficiency in Rice in 2018",
    "content": "<br />The Federal Government, on Wednesday, said the country would, in 2018, achieve rice production of seven million metric tonnes.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, who stated this in Abuja&nbsp; at a press conference on the Federal Government’s achievements&nbsp; in rice production, said Nigeria was&nbsp; “inching closer to self-sufficiency” in the crop.<br /><br />&nbsp;He stated,&nbsp; &nbsp;“By 2018, the administration targets a rice production of seven million metric tonnes.&nbsp; As of 2015, rice demand in Nigeria stood at 6.3 million metric tonnes.”<br /><br />&nbsp;The minister said the Federal Government was aware of the high price of locally produced rice, despite increase in its production.<br /><br />He, however, assured Nigerians that&nbsp; the rise in production would eventually&nbsp; lead to fall&nbsp; in the price of rice.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dYxPp5Y3uyo/WeieqnfS7kI/AAAAAAAAAf4/3xVXRCVcBh0tSaLYoLGBTVs1Cs0vFzmQQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Grain%2BReserves.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"269\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dYxPp5Y3uyo/WeieqnfS7kI/AAAAAAAAAf4/3xVXRCVcBh0tSaLYoLGBTVs1Cs0vFzmQQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Grain%2BReserves.jpeg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He stated, “I know the question agitating your minds now will be: Why is the price of locally-produced rice still on the high side despite the increased production?<br /><br />“Suffice it to say, however, that the increased production is bound to eventually bring down the price of rice and also bring succour to Nigerians.”<br /><br />He said&nbsp; the Thailand Rice Exporters’ Association&nbsp; recently revealed that within a spate of just two years – from September 2015 to September 2017 – Nigeria’s rice importation dropped from 644,131 metric tonnes to just about 21,000 metric tonnes.<br /><br />The minister said as a result of the Muhammadu Buhari administration’s success in local production, “some investors from Thailand have shown interest in establishing rice milling plants in Nigeria.”<br /><br />Muhammed assured Nigerians that the coming of the foreign investors would not drive local farmers out of business.<br /><br />According to him, the foreign investors would mostly be involved in the value chain aspect of rice production.<br /><br />&nbsp;He recalled that unlike a few years ago, Nigeria had become one of the largest producers of rice in the world.<br /><br />The minister added, “The improvement in rice production across the country did not happen by accident. It is largely due to the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme, initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari, which supports farmers through inputs distribution and loans to boost rice production.”<br /><br />He explained that the increase in rice production had led to the establishment of rice mills.<br /><br /><b>By: Niyi Odebode,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Delta’s Agro-Industrial Park: Option for Resolving Food Deficit, Youth Unemployment",
    "content": "<br />Ifeanyi-Okowa of Delta State With the return of democratic government in 1999, agriculture and the agro-allied sub-sector seemed to have been undermined, as the political elite had payed lip-service to it in the last 18 years. The worrisome aspect is the nonchalant attitude of the three tiers of government toward agriculture.<br /><br />In the real sense, the lack-luster approach to national agriculture management remains the bane of the nation’s industrial development. Interestingly, the nation is blessed with arable land from the North to the South and East to West, but the resource is grossly underutilised. According to the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO), Nigeria has no basis for the annual progression in number of unemployed youths and recorded food deficit if adequate commitment and resources are deployed to the agriculture sub-sector.<br /><br />The FAO believes that the nation’s current food deficit followed the dismal national agricultural policy, poor appreciation of the national agricultural potential and lack of commitment by the political elite to agriculture and agribusiness. It says that irrespective of the huge petrol dollars earned so far since 1970s, agriculture remains Nigeria’s cash cow. However, the Delta State Government recently took the bull by the hornto prepare its people for a life beyond crude oil and the attendant polemics.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yxoCLGhDgOc/WeCfGJc1iUI/AAAAAAAAAWc/hr5xmJDrf0c5N93_2--EHTPBlaXYB_TzwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B3.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"183\" data-original-width=\"275\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yxoCLGhDgOc/WeCfGJc1iUI/AAAAAAAAAWc/hr5xmJDrf0c5N93_2--EHTPBlaXYB_TzwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B3.jpg\" /></a></div>The consensus policy document of the State’s Executive Council released on November 12, 2017, showed that the Dr. Ifeanyi Okowa-led government has concluded plans to position his administration toward sustainable mass mobilisation of the people back to the land. The strategic agricultural and agribusiness road map as contained in the Delta States Executive Council policy document provides for the establishment of common industrial infrastructure to leapfrog into mass youth employment, while leveraging on new agricultural businesses.<br /><br />The Commissioner for Information, Mr. Patrick Ukah, describes the policy as a quiet agricultural revolution aimed at harnessing the rich agriculture potential of the state and the vast knowledge of Deltans in wholesome agriculture and agribusiness.<br /><br />&nbsp;“Our agriculture policy directive is moderated more by the developed world’s aggressive climate induced engineering targeting the complete elimination of fossil fuel by 2025; and more importantly; mobilising Deltans into mechanised agriculture and agribusiness-driven industries,’’ he says. Ukah explains that the government’s commitment to give the policy a human face followed the state Executive Council’s recent approval of N7.04 billion (about 22.7 million dollars) for the establishment of an Agro-Industrial Park at Aboh in Ogwashi-Uku, Aniocha South Local Government Area. Specifically, the government expects the agro-industrial park to play an important role in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth, job creation, foreign exchange earnings, and Small and Medium-size Enterprises (SME) development over the coming years.<br /><br />The overall the focus of the agro-industrial park development strategy is to bring about the accelerated structural transformation of the state’s economy through graduated industrialisation, leveraging the share of the industrial sector of GDP and the GDP share of the agriculture-based manufacturing sub-sector. In value terms, the development of agro-industries parks in Delta will create the catalyst and opportunity to accelerate economic development and achieve its industrialisation goals.<br /><br />The government’s agro-industrial park initiative remains a potent vehicle for the structural transformation of the state’s economy. The initiative is expected to help to pave the way for the realisation of Nigeria’s Vision 2020 of becoming a leading manufacturing hub in Africa. The agro-industrial park will also promote economic diversification and growth of the state, including creating more than 5,000 jobs along the agricultural value chain.<br /><br />It will provide a common dedicated infrastructure and facilities for agro-processing, value addition and agribusiness as a means to improving the ease-of-doing business. According to the Ukah, the park will be executed through Public-Private Partnership involving the Delta State Government, Israel-based Mirai Group and Norsworthy Investments Ltd. Under the policy, part of the money will be deployed to the construction of Ayakoromo Bridge across River Forcados in Burutu Local Government Area.<br /><br />The Ayakoromo Bridge, Ukah says, will link the riverine and upland communities in the state toward sustainable economic and social integration. He adds that with the construction of the bridge, Burutu Town, which hitherto had not been accessible by road, will become a beehive of social and economic activities with vehicular movements. According to him, government’s focus on roads also is to facilitate the easy movement of raw materials to the agro-industrial park and various markets nationwide.<br /><br />The topography of the state, the commissioner notes, provides the impetus for the executive council to appreciate the complimentary importance of roads in agriculture and agribusiness. “Our mission with the new agro-industrial policy is to turn the state into a mechanised agrarian community. “We hope that with the agricultural leadership provided by the state, the organised private sector will in a few years take over the initiative and drive of the state’s agricultural revolution,’’ Ukah says.

    "title": "Miyetti Allah Running Out Of Excuses For Opposing Grazing Law – Ortom",
    "content": "<br />Benue State government has said that the latest reasons advanced by the Miyetti&nbsp; Allah Kautal Hore&nbsp; as the basis for&nbsp; its opposition to Benue State anti-open grazing law has further portrayed the group as running out of reasons for its opposition to the law.<br /><br />Commissioner of Information and Orientation, Lawrence Onoja jnr, disclosed this to journalists, while reacting to the recent claim by the secretary of the socio-cultural&nbsp; association, Saleh&nbsp; Alhassan, that the law is meant to score a political point. Onoja said the claim is far from the truth.<br /><br />According to him, the governor will not play politics with issues affecting lives and livelihood of the people of the state, saying, it has now become clear that the socio-cultural association is playing out a script designed to plunge Benue State and by extension the nation into avoidable conflict. “This is evident, judging by the way the herdsmen association has been fanning&nbsp; embers of disunity, hatred&nbsp; and threat to peaceful coexistence in the state,” he added.<br /><br />Onoja said the claim&nbsp; by the association that the state’s geographical location is not suitable for ranching, is also misleading adding that Benue State geography is blessed with suitable climate for all forms of agriculture and animal husbandry.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mB2HyK130So/WhVPB9Me9TI/AAAAAAAAAyk/9jCVxgUFtKQFaMC60HFSDEpcMb1Pf7KtACLcBGAs/s1600/ORTOM1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"640\" data-original-width=\"890\" height=\"230\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-mB2HyK130So/WhVPB9Me9TI/AAAAAAAAAyk/9jCVxgUFtKQFaMC60HFSDEpcMb1Pf7KtACLcBGAs/s320/ORTOM1.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>He urged the leadership of the association not to hesitate in identifying the areas where the Benue anti-open grazing law violates the constitution of Nigeria, how it negatively affects the pastoralists sociology, economic interest or their migration pattern.<br /><br />On the argument by the association that the interstate movement of pastoralists is similar to interstate commerce and that it is only the&nbsp; National Assembly that can legislate on that aspect as captured in item 62 of the exclusive Legislative Assembly List of the constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, 1999 as amended and that no state governor can stop&nbsp; the movement of pastoralists and because Benue is practicing primitive agriculture, it is not fit to practice ranching, Onoja described the statement as not only absurd but also misleading.<br /><br />“A close look and analysis of item 62 (a)&nbsp; of the 1999 constitution of Exclusive Legislative List as amended, it clearly talks about trade and commerce between Nigeria and other countries including import&nbsp; and export of commodities, this item did not by any stretch of interpretation or imagination cover the movement of pastoralists.<br /><br />The Benue State Anti-open grazing Law is essentially predicated upon section 4 (7) of the constitution of the 1999 constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria as amended.”<br /><br /><b>By Hembadoon Orsar</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Agriculture: Evidence-Based Insurance Road Map For Farmers Launched",
    "content": "<br />A working paper that contains a roadmap for evidence-based insurance development for Nigeria’s farmers have been launched in Abuja.<br /><br />The public presentation of the working paper No. 218 is an outcome of a consultative process that began in September 2014 between the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development and the CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS).<br /><br />The research was aimed to overcome the problems of moral hazard, adverse selection, and resulting high transaction costs and processing delays that have plagued indemnity-based agricultural insurance. Index based insurance makes it feasible to insure millions of smallholder farmers.<br /><br />Launching the document at the headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture in Abuja, permanent secretary of the Ministry, Dr Bukar Hassan, represented by the director, Lands and Climate Change, Engr. Sunday Edibo, said the launch is coming at no other time than now that the challenge of climate change has become impactful particularly to the agricultural sector and most especially to the small hold farmers in the country.<br /><br />He commended the thoughtful foresight and collaborative efforts of CLAT, CCAFS of the CGIAR and the Ministry for the achievement.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2O9f1RVwyWM/WhVOmbq0N8I/AAAAAAAAAyg/yODQaBp7TzoAtNdEbAlcVT_soR82l1LgQCLcBGAs/s1600/CCAFS.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"900\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-2O9f1RVwyWM/WhVOmbq0N8I/AAAAAAAAAyg/yODQaBp7TzoAtNdEbAlcVT_soR82l1LgQCLcBGAs/s320/CCAFS.jpeg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“As you are aware, 70 per cent of the population is engaged in agriculture while agriculture contributes about 24 percent to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).<br /><br />“Yet our agriculture is rain fed dependent, that is, farmers rely hugely on the vagaries of weather and climate.<br />“Though, it has been acknowledged that climate change is a global phenomenon and a reality, its impacts has been devastating as floods or drought can wipe out the entire harvest of farmers. This was the case of our farmers in 2012 and recently in 2017,” he said.<br /><br />Hassan, stated that to ensure food security and nutrition, farmers should insure their crops and obtain some financial support in the event of the occurrence of any disaster.<br /><br />“This is the new direction, a paradigm shift practices in the developed and developing countries. Nigeria should not be left of this robust and tested scientific endeavour. This, perhaps, is the reason we are here today to launch an Insurance Roadmap Document for Nigerian Farmers developed by CIAT in collaboration with the Ministry.”<br /><br />He also noted that the launch strengthens the role of insurance in Nigeria’s agricultural resilience policy, through improved data management and sharing, and by building awareness among farmers and the financial sector to support new insurance and financial packages for farmers.<br /><br />Speaking on the occasion, CCAFS flagship 4 leader and a senior research scientist at the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI), New York, USA, Dr James Hansen, said well designed index insurance can achieve specific risk objectives such as protecting farmers livelihoods in the face of major climate shocks, and promoting farmers’ livelihoods by overcoming barriers to adoption of improved agricultural technologies and practices, and access to market opportunities.<br />He said agriculture insurance is a well-established crop farmers’ resilience in the face of various production risks.<br /><br />“The United States Federal Recover Insurance Corporation, for example, was created in 1938 to help the agricultural sector 2015) from the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl drought.<br /><br />“Agriculture insurance in the United States has, over the years, proven to be more efficient than providing post-disaster payments to farmers. Globally, insurance products have evolved to become more cost-effective, and to reach both large and small-scale farmers.<br /><br />He said the federal government in partnership with the private sector, can address the challenges in the agricultural insurance sector if the right strategy is implemented.<br /><br /><b>By Agbo-Paul Augustine&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "No fewer than 10 people are in critical conditions in a private hospital at Igangan, Oke Ogun area of Oyo State, following injuries they sustained in a clash between farmers and herdsmen in the area. One of the injured The victims were allegedly attacked with machetes and other dangerous weapons by the herdsmen, who accused their hosts of killing about 15 of their cows in the last two weeks.<br /><br />Vanguard gathered that the farmers were accused of putting poisonous tubers of cassava and other items on the grazing tracks. One of the residents of Igangan, who disclosed that the villagers now live in fear, said the quick intervention of the National President of Jamu Nati Fulbe Association of Nigeria, Alhaji Saliu Kadir, who also doubles as the Sarkin Fulani of Igangan, restored temporary peace.<br /><br />Emergency meeting Speaking after an emergency meeting the Fulani community had with the Police, Army, Nigerian Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, and the Department of State Services, DSS, Alhaji Kadir disclosed that “15 cows have been killed by the farmers.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_OTNthc0ENs/Wd_SApnhJiI/AAAAAAAAAT0/-qhgjWj_pcEoqDdkvm0wYDftwr72cuoJACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Fulani.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_OTNthc0ENs/Wd_SApnhJiI/AAAAAAAAAT0/-qhgjWj_pcEoqDdkvm0wYDftwr72cuoJACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Fulani.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“They poisoned some crops which they put on the tracks that the cattle usually take. My people actually wanted to avenge the death of their cattle, but I calmed them down by telling them that Governor Abiola Ajimobi, the Commissioner of Police and other security agencies in the state should be allowed to address the issue.<br /><br />“I believe they will attend to the issue without delay.” He recalled that there is an existing agreement between the Fulani herdsmen and the farmers on the modalities for payment of compensation in the case of any straying cattle encroaching into farmlands, but lamented that the agreement is now being abused by the farmers.<br /><br />He noted: “There are times that the farmers would make us pay heavy compensation that is not commensurate with the crops destroyed by the cattle. Yet, we pay the compensation without complaining.” Peace meeting At a peace meeting summoned to calm frayed nerves, one of the farmers in the area, Chief Oludele Oyedepo, Baale Agbe Tapa, also called for peace.<br /><br />He said: “We agreed at one of our meetings that a farmer has the right to apply any chemical on his crops, but what is the justification for putting poisoned food on the footpath for cattle? “Sarkin called me one day and said someone should take me to a grazing track. I used my hand to pick many tubers of poisoned cassava on the path.<br /><br />“At another time when we had a meeting at the Police Commissioner’s office, there were about 11 bags of such items brought to the CP’s office as proofs. It is better we live in peace with one another.”<br /><b><br /></b><b>By Ola Ajayi&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "How Piggery Farming is Changing Lives",
    "content": "<br />A conference was organised by the Association for Promotion of Piggery in Nigeria (APPN) in Lagos to review smallholder pig value chain. It provided&nbsp; an&nbsp; opportunity to share testimonies of how the business has changed lives, DANIEL ESSIET, who attended the forum, reports.<br /><br />As a young man growing up in the rural setting of Oyo town, Oyo State, Wale Adekoya knew that his future is in agribusiness. He had developed interest in farming since he was a boy. He had no formal training in raising pigs, but he was fortunate to have observed his father raising the animals. As a child, he had learnt how to feed pigs with inexpensive foods. But his plan to be a big farmer lacked one basic ingredient – the technical knowledge to ensure that the business thrived.<br /><br />Never to be discouraged easily, he took up menial jobs&nbsp; before he returned to piggery business. After having some positive experiences with using herbs, he started checking out medicinal herbs to see what they had to offer in treating pig’s ailments. He said the herbs&nbsp; helped him effectively to deal with pig diseases.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q1bjgWinVXU/WhP0l5V1GvI/AAAAAAAAAxk/Aa6bcW3h3RsS9HeEWvMjJkj_5U6DIhZkQCLcBGAs/s1600/pigfarm.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-q1bjgWinVXU/WhP0l5V1GvI/AAAAAAAAAxk/Aa6bcW3h3RsS9HeEWvMjJkj_5U6DIhZkQCLcBGAs/s320/pigfarm.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Today, hard work, perseverance and a little luck have seen Adekoya turning a tiny enterprise of 10 pigs into a flourishing commercial operation with 300 pigs. Considering the fact that he started&nbsp; with 10 pigs is quite an achievement. He is satisfied with raising pigs, and happy that his standard of living is changing for the better.<br /><br />According to him, pig farming is helping many farmers to increase their income. He was one of the panelists at the conference and annual general meeting (AGM) ofAPPN in Lagos. His story is a testimony of how not giving up pays in the end.<br /><br />Adekoya said&nbsp; pigs’ pork is in huge demand, adding that a lot of people&nbsp; have&nbsp; approached him for different pig parts .&nbsp; Though he has made a success of it, he still feels people do not respect the piggery business.<br /><br />He said shortage of butchery skills is one of the challenges faced by the pig farming industry. Piggery farming, he said, proves to be lucrative, but it comes with several challenges.<br /><br />Successful piggery farming, he said, is underpinned by having sufficient scale and market knowledge to produce healthy piglets cost-effectively, while still managing risks.<br /><br />With this comes marketing. Currently, he&nbsp; sells most of his pork directly to retailers, who buy in bulk from him on a weekly basis.<br /><br />Also, Chairman, Board of Trustees, APPN, Olootu Dipo Shofowora said with less than 10 piglets, he&nbsp; now owns a big piggery operation.<br /><br /><br /><br />He maintained that&nbsp; piggery, like poultry, should be&nbsp; one of the areas that government should&nbsp; prioritise as the base of meat industry, where more private operators&nbsp; will be encouraged to invest money in a professional way.<br /><br />For the private sector and people&nbsp; interested in the sector, Shofowora, also the Chairman, First Crystal Integrated&nbsp; Agriculture Limited,&nbsp; said there are still many opportunities to be explored.<br /><br />He added that the market for pork and piglets is still so big, requiring more investors to satisfy it. With hard work, he said anyone can start piggery business and be a success.<br /><br />To achieve a good litter, he said one needs good selection of healthy and stress-free breeds. He explained that a pig’s gestation period is three months, three weeks and three days. This means that if one&nbsp; wean after one month, the mother should move back to production cycle soon enough and, therefore, help one&nbsp; achieve two litters a year.<br /><br />Shofowora explained&nbsp; that farmers, who&nbsp; want to be successful commercial producers like him, need to receive intensive mentorship from established producers.<br /><br />As part of mentorship programme, he said young farmers must learn to keep a close watch on the disease status of the units&nbsp; where there is no veterinary doctors.<br /><br />He said the main challenge new entrants is finding a way of converting basic, informal pig-keeping operations into profitable commercial enterprises.<br /><br />This, he explained, is hampered by high initial capital costs and subsequent high maintenance and feed expenditure. Moreover, he stressed that pig&nbsp; farmers need to look for new or alternative markets to increase the country’s per capita pork consumption if they wish to sustain profitability.<br /><br />He said inadequate number of modern facilities such as&nbsp; abattoirs, processing plants, feed makers and laboratories are some of the biggest challenges the sector faces.<br /><br />He noted that reluctance of financial institutions to finance agriculture has affected piggery production and expansion efforts.<br /><br />He added that cultural and religious beliefs also affect the growth of the sub-sector, pointing out that the cost of production is high because of high cost of pig feeds.<br /><br />Head, Animal Production Department, Federal College of Animal Health and Production Technology, Ibadan, Oyo State, Dr Joseph Olupona, urged pig producers to work towards transforming the piggery sub-sector to a market-oriented one that creates value through&nbsp; processing and value addition.<br /><br />He explained that common constraints shared by many producers are numerous, from government policies, land acquisition issues, lack of infrastructure, funding, processing and storage facilities, and market linkage among others.<br /><br />Lagos State government said&nbsp; it&nbsp; will do everything possible to support farmers to ensure abundant food production in the state.<br /><br />Represented by the Head of Livestock services, Ministry of Agriculture, Babatunde Shonekan, the state government&nbsp; said it has continued to intensify efforts in the agricultural areas where it has comparative ecological and socio-economic advantages.<br /><br />He said despite its high industrialised status, population density and pressure on land for non-agricultural purposes, these areas, according to him, include fisheries, livestock as well as agro-processing with emphasis on value addition.<br /><br />He stated that furtherance to the ministry’s effort to boost food production in the state, it has acquired 1000 hectares of land in Ogun State.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

It gives information on agriculture generally.”<br /><br />Speaking on the app with is themed ‘Farm in the pocket’, Onyeka noted the launch of the Farmcrowdy mobile app would provide a more accessible platform for agriculture enthusiasts to experience, learn and appreciate agriculture practice first-hand.<br /><br />Since the launch of its website 12 months ago, Farmcrowdy has recorded up to 1,000 unique farm sponsors, aggregated a combined 4,000 acres of farmland in Nigeria for farming purpose and grown over 150,000 organic chickens to date.

    "title": "N2 Billion Chicken Wasting Away",
    "content": "The statement made by the immediate past President of the Poultry Association of Nigeria, PAN, Dr Ayoola Oduntan, that N2 billion worth of locally produced chicken are wasting away in cold rooms in Nigeria, should embarrass all Nigerians as it makes a complete mockery of our Made-in-Nigeria slogan. It should also challenge us to save Nigeria’s poultry sector from collapse and boost our efforts at economic diversification.<br /><br />Two billion naira worth of chicken, for a nation with a population of close to 180 million is not a lot, though to the poor chicken farmers operating in our difficult and underdeveloped environment, it is a colossal loss. The approximately one million birds involved come to one chicken per 180 Nigerians.<br /><br />Then why are they being allowed to waste away? The answer lies in our collective lack of patriotism and the failure of the Nigerian Customs Service, NCS, to effectively protect our local farmers and industrialists from foreign competitors.<br /><br />Far more than one million birds are smuggled into Nigeria every week and sold in supermarkets and other open markets while the Customs and the rest of us pretend not to notice.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WYKUbz0qiEw/WdcyfyRZCXI/AAAAAAAAAQU/I7OkOgmlURg8a2gq9uYPZCsKgdQMM80kQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Chicken%2BProcessing%2BPlant.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"180\" data-original-width=\"279\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WYKUbz0qiEw/WdcyfyRZCXI/AAAAAAAAAQU/I7OkOgmlURg8a2gq9uYPZCsKgdQMM80kQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Chicken%2BProcessing%2BPlant.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Governments at Federal and state levels have to join hands to stamp out the smuggling of poultry products into the country by enacting laws in every state prohibiting the sale of chicken not bred in Nigeria.<br /><br />The penalties should be stiff enough to compel compliance. In any case, a lot of the poultry products imported into this country are suspect in terms of handling, with little care taken to protect Nigerians from harmful preservatives. The Poultry Association of Nigeria, PAN, must also help itself. The truth is, most poultry firms only produce chicken and eggs.<br /><br />Most of them have no concrete sales plans. They hardly employ sales people; they expect customers to line up in front of their gates to buy what they produce. That is a fundamental flaw which the PAN must correct among its members.<br /><br />The world will not come to them; they must come out to sell their products. Nothing stops PAN from helping its members develop their marketing channels and raising awareness among ordinary Nigerians on the nutritional and health benefits of poultry products.<br /><br />PAN and its members can also benefit from the experiences of their peers in foreign countries. We are convinced that the wasting chicken in the cold-rooms is not as a result of product glut. The products are simply not being taken to the doorsteps of the consumers.<br /><br />The Federal and state governments have a duty to partner with PAN and its members to develop the poultry sector of the economy. That is another job creation efforts.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "How to Start a Pineapple Farm",
    "content": "<br />Pineapple is a highly valuable fruit among Nigerians, and also a highly lucrative crop to grow because it is sold for both domestic consumption and for production of fruit juice.<br /><br />It is imperative upon a farmer to select sweet and high yielding pineapple varieties like the Smooth Cayenne which is very popular or the Queen cultivar which produces sweeter but smaller fruits than the Smooth Cayenne but with spiny leaves which are difficult to work with.<br /><br />Another cultivar popular across West Africa is the Red Spanish, a spineless cultivar, which has some level of resistance to mealy bug wilt disease, and is intermediate between the Smooth Cayenne and Queen.<br /><br />To start pineapple production, it is very important that a farmer chooses a good farm with deep sandy loam, but could also be grown on other soil types provided organic matter is added and it’s free of water logging conditions.<br /><br />It is fairly drought resistant, but performs best in an area with a well distributed rainfall of at least 1000mm per annum. It enjoys humid conditions and prefers soil with good water retention ability.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JUZqVrpKcn8/Wg1OZiD2n3I/AAAAAAAAAvk/m0eKs23WjkY7uULyZlfkK9F11IUfHu5JgCLcBGAs/s1600/Pineapple%2BPlantation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JUZqVrpKcn8/Wg1OZiD2n3I/AAAAAAAAAvk/m0eKs23WjkY7uULyZlfkK9F11IUfHu5JgCLcBGAs/s320/Pineapple%2BPlantation.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Secondly, the land should be cleared of stumps and ploughed in preparation for planting. Raised beds or making some raised beds for the planting.<br /><br /><b>Propagation:</b> Pineapples could be grown from either the top (crown), sucker or by their slip (tiny plantlets at the bottom of the fruit).<br /><br />Suckers are little plantlets that grow between the leaves of the mature pineapple.<br /><br />Pineapple plants rely mostly on their leaves for water and nutrition, as such could be planted in a nursery and transplanted to the main field when they are about a foot tall so that you have rows of similar sized pineapples.<br /><br />Planting should be done at the onset of rainy season or at any time in irrigated areas.<br /><br /><b>Spacing: </b>Ideally, pineapples are planted in double row spacing at 60cm between the rows, 30cm between plants and about 120cm between adjacent double rows.<br /><br />Ridging should be preferably done after planting the propagules 7cm to 10cm deep on a levelled ground.<br /><br /><b>Nutritional requirement: </b>Nitrogen fertiliser could be applied at the rate of 50 kg per hectare by broadcasting one month after planting.<br /><br />Additionally, 41kg to 670kg per hectare should be applied at three to six months interval before maturity.<br /><br /><b>Harvesting: </b>Pineapples mature 15-24 months depending on the planting material used. In harvesting, it is best to cut, rather than to break the fruit by the stalk.<br /><br /><b>Important tips:</b><br />• Weeds need to be effectively managed.<br />• At least two ratoon crops can be grown from the mother crop.<br />• Only one sucker should remain as the basis of the ratoon crop.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

He urged government to invest more in the crop which has great health value and is also financially greater than rice, maize and other crops.<br /><br />On his part, Teryima Iorlamen, a Principal Investigator with IITA, told the farmers that the cultivation of cowpea in commercial quantity has come to stay, pointing out that with the success of the programme, there will be huge market for the crop in the state.<br /><br />He particularly called on women and the youth to take advantage of the programme and go into farming cowpea due to its potentials.<br /><br />The representative of the district head, Chief Abraham Igyande, said with the breakthrough recorded in the cultivation and harvest of the crop, more farmers in the area will get involved and more land will be made available for cultivation.<br /><br /><b>By Hope Abah,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Engaging NYSC Members in Agric Extension Services",
    "content": "<br />Years past, it was very common to have NYSC farms dotting the nation’s landscape. This was a laudable initiative designed to more usefully engage the National Youth Service corps members and to address part of the food needs of the nation and by extension, food needs of various NYSC orientation camps. This goes to underscore the importance attached to agriculture for the nation’s economic well-being and food sustainability.<br /><br />Time was, and in some cases even now, when Youth Corps members were rejected with abandon in the banks and industries. But, with our massive landmass and agricultural endowments, it becomes easier to more productively engage the corps members in agriculture. This is also in line with the policy of utilising sizeable percentage of NYSC members in agriculture and rural schools.<br /><br />With the current emphasis on broadly diversifying our economic base on account of dwindling fortunes of our mono-product, oil, it makes more sense to engage our teeming corps members in agricultural activities during their service year.<br /><br />Agricultural extension programmes are ready aspects of agriculture that yearn for the involvement of our NYSC members. For the one year of the national service, most of the NYSC members will see their agricultural extension service initiatives through to fruition before their disengagement from service. Where the crops or animals take more than a year to mature, succeeding NYSC batches can take over the management till maturity and harvest.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Isu0CMm9mk/WgwE-BR2fDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/gh3W3m-nN90vxjYKGwyPIrB3dMePmYb3QCLcBGAs/s1600/nysc-1-300x141.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"141\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Isu0CMm9mk/WgwE-BR2fDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/gh3W3m-nN90vxjYKGwyPIrB3dMePmYb3QCLcBGAs/s1600/nysc-1-300x141.jpg\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Isu0CMm9mk/WgwE-BR2fDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/gh3W3m-nN90vxjYKGwyPIrB3dMePmYb3QCLcBGAs/s1600/nysc-1-300x141.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"141\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Isu0CMm9mk/WgwE-BR2fDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/gh3W3m-nN90vxjYKGwyPIrB3dMePmYb3QCLcBGAs/s1600/nysc-1-300x141.jpg\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Isu0CMm9mk/WgwE-BR2fDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/gh3W3m-nN90vxjYKGwyPIrB3dMePmYb3QCLcBGAs/s1600/nysc-1-300x141.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"141\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9Isu0CMm9mk/WgwE-BR2fDI/AAAAAAAAAuY/gh3W3m-nN90vxjYKGwyPIrB3dMePmYb3QCLcBGAs/s1600/nysc-1-300x141.jpg\" /></a></div><br />While it may be easier to use conventional agricultural extensionists in this respect, most youth corps personnel with agriculture bias, can as well with little orientation, deliver on this initiative.<br /><br />NYSC Agricultural Extension Specialists, already with agriculture background, are deemed sufficiently equipped with requisite knowledge, skills and attitudes in agricultural development processes, and possess the competences that can effectively transmit the skills and knowledge to local farmers for optimum productivity.<br /><br />Agricultural extension, being the application of scientific research and new knowledge of agricultural practices through farmer education, perfectly positions agriculture-oriented corps members to deliver on this and drive innovations. These innovations can be in the areas of animal production, crop production and apiculture practices; land preparation techniques, and agri-marketing principles, practices and strategies.<br /><br />Armed with management principles, the NYSC members will assist farmers to enhance management of their fish, poultry, sheep, goat and pig farms, etc., through agriculture information dissemination to individual farmers and farmer groups.<br /><br />Some NYSC members in their various places of primary assignment are usually grossly underutilised. NYSC farms, when effectively re-introduced and possibly established in each of the 774 local government areas, will help to maximally absorb, unlock and utilise the potentials of the corps members. Products from these farms can conveniently satisfy the food needs of successive NYSC batches in their orientation camps before deployment to their areas of primary assignment. When there is a lull in activities that will keep them very busy in the course of executing Community Development Projects, they can more gainfully engage themselves in the NYSC farms. To fully realize this, it is expected that the respective state governments and local councils should equip them sufficiently in terms of parcels of land, equipment, machinery, implements, inputs and logistics to execute these programmes seamlessly.<br /><br />Outcome of possible research activities on soil, crop and animals from these NYSC farms can be made available to outreach farmers for adoption. This is the way uneducated adopted village farmers will benefit from the wealth of knowledge of these corps members gained from latest national and international research findings. Change of attitude and behaviour of local farmers resulting from these extension activities will most certainly change their lives and living standards for the better<br /><br />While using the medium of NYSC farms to render consultancy and information services to local farmers, the farmers will see the need for membership of various farmer cooperatives and other farmer organisations. This will also address most of their challenges like sourcing of funds, utilizing feasibility reports, and accessing improved input varieties for optimal yield.<br /><br />With NYSC farms as research bases, corps members will be educating farmers on proper utilization of their products through application of value chain or value addition methods. This way, wastes will be checked; their undue exploitation obviated, and their income enhanced to justify the efforts and resources exp,ended. Identified agri-business niching can also be introduced to tap into hitherto unexplored but nonetheless lucrative aspects of agri-business.<br /><br />As part of their outreach education and enlightenment, NYSC members will put farmers through the economics of various crop production techniques for enhanced profitability. They should sensitize the local farmers to the health implications of their animal rearing practices and the need for eradication of pests and diseases of their crops.<br /><br />As links to various tiers of government, the corps members can communicate current agricultural empowerment schemes to the local farmers and educate them on desirable storage systems, modern processing techniques and accessibility to credit.<br /><br />In the era of inadequate agricultural extension staff in Nigeria, NYSC members, through their farm schemes, will readily come to the rescue. With all the experiences gained, participating NYSC members, through this NYSC farm scheme, would have grown to love different facets of agriculture beyond theory to the point of embracing them for entrepreneurial projects.<br /><br />From the foregoing, it is hoped that since most successive Federal Government administrations did not see a serious need for effective revival or sustenance of NYSC farms, the current President Muhammadu Buhari regime’s Green Alternative Agriculture Policy, will be remembered for putting NYSC Farms Programme back on track by giving it all the needed encouragement. This will include motivating NYSC members who studied agriculture with special incentives to engender enthusiasm. In doing this, all the 774 local councils, without exception, would be target beneficiaries of grassroots NYSC agricultural extension services.<br /><br />This advocated NYSC Farm programme, with government support, should be attractive enough and devoid of any form of rhetoric&nbsp; to make the farm a compulsory place to be for successive large batches of National Youth Service Corps members with agriculture background. The nation’s land mass is massive enough to engage and feed the populace, including NYSC members, if the potentials of our vast arable lands are fully harnessed.<br /><br />Obasi writes from Federal College of Agriculture, Ishiagu, Ebonyi State, via <b><i><span style=\"color: blue;\">egwu.benedict@yahoo.com</span></i></b><br /><br /><b>By: Egwu Ben Obasi</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Two workers of the Institute of Agricultural Research and Training, Moor Plantation, Ibadan, Oyo State, are receiving treatment at the University College, Ibadan, after they were hit by bullets during a clash between the police and students of the Federal College of Agriculture, Ibadan on Monday.<br /><br />The college, the research institute and the Federal College of Animal Health and Technology share the same premises at the Moor plantation.<br /><br />Crisis erupted on Monday when the students of FCA clashed with the police during a protest against their inability to receive lectures due to a disagreement between the school Provost, Dr Babajide Adelekan, and the lecturers.<br /><br />Our correspondent, who visited the UCH on Tuesday, observed that one of the injured, Mrs. Helen Adekanmi, who works at the Crop Production Unit of the research institute, was admitted to the South-West 1 ward of the hospital after a surgery on Monday night.<br /><br />The bullet pierced through her navel and ruptured part of her lower abdomen.<br /><br />Although she could not speak when our correspondent visited her at the ward, the Public Relations Officer of the institute, Mr. Adeniyi Hamzat, said the police stray bullet hit her when they shot towards the offices of the institute.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--u3FGAjiBfk/Wgvz6IhLuWI/AAAAAAAAAuI/DnyNACoYPWUAqK9zXYK1eX-KQCtMWocNQCLcBGAs/s1600/News.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"135\" data-original-width=\"374\" height=\"115\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/--u3FGAjiBfk/Wgvz6IhLuWI/AAAAAAAAAuI/DnyNACoYPWUAqK9zXYK1eX-KQCtMWocNQCLcBGAs/s320/News.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Also, Miss Kobaju Busayo, who was observing her Industrial Training programme at the institute, was being attended to at the Emergency Care Unit of the UCH.<br /><br />&nbsp;It was learnt that a bullet also pierced through her left thigh, causing severe damage to the leg.<br /><br />Apart from the two workers of the institute, two vehicles belonging to lecturers of FCA were vandalised, while the students claimed that eight of their colleagues were injured.<br /><br />They also refuted police claim that eight police vans were damaged during the unrest.<br /><br />One of the students, who identified himself only as Oladeji, said, “The protest was peaceful at first. It was to create awareness to what we have been facing for the past three months. The institution had been practically closed during the period. Around 9am, policemen from the Apata division came and we expressed our grievances to them.<br /><br />“Thirty minutes later, they returned with guns and tear gas. They shot at us and we went back to the institution and closed our gates. Ten minutes later, they returned with Armoured Personnel Carriers, which they drove round the school. They attacked us with planks, axes and guns.<br /><br />“They came with three vans and none was vandalised. No policeman was injured. We took some of our colleagues that were injured to a hospital on Oluyole Estate and they were rejected. The Commissioner of Police in the state knows about our problem and he had met us and the school management on the issue. We are law-abiding citizens. We do not have ammunition. They attacked us first and we have video evidence. We did not throw stones at the police. They entered the school and beat us up.”<br /><br />The school’s Assistant Chief Technologist, Adisa Lawal, who claimed that his car was damaged in the protest, said the car was parked outside the premises when the students locked the gate.<br /><br />“The gunshots lasted three hours. When it stopped, I went to take my car, but I met it vandalised; I don’t know who did it,” he said.<br /><br />Another worker of the school, Lawal Adesola, said his car was parked outside the school gate and that when he returned to pick it, it was damaged.<br /><br />When contacted for comment on a picture showing a policeman with an axe and seemingly attacking a student, the state Police Public Relations Officer, Adekunle Ajisebutu, said it was one of the weapons recovered from the students.<br /><br />“That (axe) was one of the weapons recovered from the students. Policemen don’t use axe. Whoever posted that picture online is being mischievous,” he added.<br /><br />Ajisebutu said he was not aware that the police shot at anyone, while also directing our correspondent to the state Commissioner of Police, Abiodun Odude, for further comments.<br /><br />While denying the claim that the police shot the victims, Odude accused the students of being in possession of firearms.<br /><br />He said, “The students had firearms in their possession. On Sunday, two students were arrested with sophisticated firearms in Ibadan. If anyone was shot at, ask the students. The picture of a policeman holding an axe was wrongly understood.”<br /><br />Meanwhile, it was gathered that some students of the school on Tuesday went on the rampage and destroyed glass windows of the school buildings.<br /><br />According to a source, the students took the action because five of their colleagues were arrested by the police in connection with the crisis.<br /><br />He said the youths had issued a 24-hour ultimatum to the police after which they would burn down the administrative department of the school if their colleagues were not released.<br /><br /><b>By: Olufemi Atoyebi,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why Nigeria Needs to Stop Pesticide Importation",
    "content": "<br />Farmers have gotten used to spraying all manners of pesticides on their farms<br /><br />Following a recent claim by the Executive Director of the Nigerian Stored Products Research Institute (NSPRI), Prof Olufemi Peters that Nigerian farmers and agro-based companies spend USD400 million annually on pesticides, Daily Trust examines the situation and discusses with experts on possible alternatives as to how the country can be self-reliant on pesticide formulation to meet up Nigerian farmers’ demand.<br /><br />Against this backdrop, Prof Olufemi noted that theinstitute has developeda safe, effective storage pesticide known as ‘NSPRI-dust’, which could be used to store grains. The grains include maize, sorghum, paddy rice and wheat which could be stored for up to 24 to 48 months, while cowpea (beans) could be stored for up to 36 months.<br /><br />Although the product is yet to be commercialised, it has been already adopted by some institutions, markets and other interested persons.<br /><br />Professor Mohammed Faguci Ishaku of the Ahmadu Bello University’s Institute for Agricultural Research (IAR), Zaria was quoted as saying Nigeria could save up to N16 billion on growing maruca resistant cowpea alone, the cost that would have otherwise been spent on buying pesticides.<br /><br />He said this at the sensitisation workshop for the Nigerian Seed Industry on genetically modified seeds held at the Nigerian Agricultural Seed Council (NASC).<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZwpE5pE5qFM/Wgr43joZVuI/AAAAAAAAAt4/QvB_VU-qFVkVK44FpRq9y7EMvmZf67AfgCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmer%2Busing%2BPesticide.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em;

compounds that are effective against several insects, fungi, bacteria,&nbsp; nematodes among others, in addition to control of striga, a noxious weed known locally as ‘wuta-wuta’ in Hausa.<br /><br />The neem processing plant at Katsina constructed by the Obasanjo administration was left to rot away until it was finally sold out to a foreign company with little or no significant production till date.<br /><br />Another Don at the Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University Zaria, Prof Salihu Dadari lamented that Nigerian markets and borders are very porous which allows sub-standard products to make way into the country.<br /><br />Prof Dadari hinted that the USD400 million allegedly spent on pesticides by farmers and agro-allied industries could be an underestimation because people bring all sorts of pesticides in to the country through the border of Niger, Benin Republic, Chad and Cameroun.<br /><br />“If you enter our market now, you will see all forms of pesticides; insecticides, nematicides, fungicides, some are of low quality, some are of high quality.The Paraquat chemical for example has carcinogenic compounds but you see it all over the country and it has been banned in many countries.”<br /><br />“You know they have to control insect in cowpea and all the horticultural crops but all these things have side effect many people have kidney problem, many people are diabetic patients and even cancer, all these things are associated with these pesticides,” he said.<br /><br />He noted that although the alternative could be organic pesticides, such products are still at infancy level and not adequate enough.<br /><br />Prof Dadari blamed the poor state of Nigerian legal and judicial system for the illegal importation of all sorts of agro-chemicals into the country. He said perpetrators of such act need to be tried and brought to book to serve as deterrent to other erring individuals.<br /><br />He charged Government to look inwards and have a functional research framework that would financially support researchers to look into the various beneficial herbs suitable for pesticide formulation, adding that through partnerships, the issue of funding of research could be effectively dealt with to ensure continuity of the project.<br /><br />Again, Prof Dadari stressed on the need for the country to have a functional legal and judicial system, authenticate the legal procedures and people that are found wanting should be brought to book and punished accordingly.<br /><br />“Nigeria has to re-orientate her law and order, our problem is very big we have to follow law and order of the land but we are not following it. Also the problem with our judiciary system, if you give them money you are gone so they don’t implement the laws of the land,” he said.<br /><br />&nbsp;Are coming in so anybody can bring anything here sell and make money, most of them are impure while some are polluted&nbsp; and with that&nbsp; the children carry ….&nbsp; People have been seen wrongly they normally inhaled them , by the time you apply them a bite culture,&nbsp; controller eye something&nbsp; so some get excess and this excess you will not know on till after some years&nbsp; and the old is two years most of this product have been banned in some advance country they have stop using them, they are common in Nigeria they are killing them self indirectly, so the issues is that all these diseases we have are associated with these chemicals like this rice we call foreign rice they have been stored with chemicals for 10 years more than 10years because they have to control insects and when they bring them to Nigeria we see our women and men who are ignorant we say I want foreign rice all this things are dangerous to us plus the carryover pesticides in the field.<br /><br />But the current Customs boss Hameed Ali is trying to bring in some sanity, so he has already arrested some of them and they know he can pursue them up to the court but the issue is that they would be bailed.<br /><br />So everything we are doing is already polluted with these chemicals. So the figures he gave were even under estimated because in every village you go you see chemicals, some are poor quality, others are<br /><br />So we cannot develop under false pretext, there has to be law and order. Because of the fragmentation of our legal system, that is why you see this kind of proliferation.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Ostrich Farming: Multi-million Naira Bird Business",
    "content": "<br />Ostrich, scientifically known as Struthio camelus, is the largest and heaviest living bird on earth. It belongs to Struthio genus of ratite family of flightless birds, native to Africa, and is the only extant of genus Struthio.<br /><br />Ostrich farming business in Nigeria is not very common but it is perhaps the most lucrative and easiest to maintain type of bird farming anywhere in the world. Ostriches produce more meat than cattle and contain the least fat, calories and cholesterol of all meats (beef, chicken, pork, lamb and turkey).<br /><br />The flightless bird is profitable going by its various products but people are yet to maximise its profitability potential. People who are into the ostrich farming business are regarded as millionaires as they are making their money both in local and foreign currency.<br /><br />Investigations revealed that Mamadou Coulibaly, an ostrich farmer with a flock of 3,000 birds in his native Mali, raked in an income of $1.4 million from ostrich business in 2011 and continues to grow in leaps.<br /><br />To give you an idea of the profitability of this business, a breeding ostrich can sell for up to $5,000 and those with feathers, which are highly prized in fashion and décor circles, can be sold for up to $3,000.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OiUgqxseG9I/Wgl9RQPOGwI/AAAAAAAAAto/DDDfNhXOn6IVL9AWnIqXIysZE1kIkIh0wCLcBGAs/s1600/OSTRICH.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"143\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OiUgqxseG9I/Wgl9RQPOGwI/AAAAAAAAAto/DDDfNhXOn6IVL9AWnIqXIysZE1kIkIh0wCLcBGAs/s1600/OSTRICH.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Information obtained from American Ostrich Growers Meat Company’s website shows that current international price for chicks 30 to 60 days old sell for $525, chicks 61 to 90 days old sell for $625, juveniles 91 days old and above goes for $975, fresh eggs sell for $45 each, eggs shell sell for $20 each and egg shells per dozen sell for $180.<br /><br />Due to the big size of ostrich, international market for it is rising, the demand for live export is also on the rise. Countries like USA, China, Holland, France, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates (UAE) and South Africa are demanding for live export of the bird.<br /><br />The reason you should invest in this lucrative business is that everything about an ostrich is marketable. The feathers of the ostrich can be sold in Europe and America for decoration purposes; the faeces find its use as fertilisers by farmers.<br /><br />Mostly, ostrich feeds on leaves, fruits, grains, small animals (rats, etc) and tubers like cassava, cocoyam, potatoes, yam and enough water. Today, Jovana has very good feed-mix that can be formulated from feed mill centres to boost fast growth. Concerning mortality rate, as the largest bird in the world, ostrich has the strongest body immunity to diseases more than any other bird in existence. They are given no steroid, hormones, chemicals or vaccines. After about 18 months, the laying of eggs start for domesticated birds, fertilisation of egg is internal. A bird well cared for can lay up to 60 eggs in a year, and each egg is as big as children’s football.<br /><br />An investor who really wants to go into this business will need at least half plot of land. The land should be fenced only to prevent the birds from moving away on their own from the farm.<br /><br />The Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer of Jovana Integrated Farms, Prince Arinze Onebunne, said that every part of ostrich production is profitable, from the meat, eggs, chicks, oils, plumes and hides.<br /><br />He said, “ostrich meat is red meat with a difference. It is similar in taste and texture to that of beef but unlike beef, it is characteristically high in protein yet low in fat. It is therefore quite clearly preferable table meat from the health point of view and is increasingly recommended by nutritionists, especially for the elderly and people living with chronic diseases that require modified diets.<br /><br />“The ostrich is very adaptable and thrives under extreme conditions. Your ostrich may outlive you! It can live for up to 100 years and can remain productive i.e. laying eggs for up to 45 years. The ostrich hen can lay between 30 and 100 eggs per year with an average of 45-50 eggs. The ostrich lays the largest egg of any living bird.”<br /><br />He explained that the world is now switching to ostrich as it is the livestock of the future because it is far more prolific and easier to raise than other livestock, particularly cattle.<br /><br />“In fact, many cattle ranches are now being converted to ostrich farms. Ostrich skin is the world’s finest leather and therefore most expensive. You can obtain about 14 square feet of leather from each 14-month-old bird with a total of about $400 to $500. This is apart from the carcass value, the eggs, oil and other benefits. When compared with traditional livestock, ostriches rate very highly.<br /><br />“Whereas a cow produces a calf every year that reaches marketing weight after 654 days from conception, yielding 250kg of meat, an ostrich produces not less than 40 chicks annually that reach marketing age after only 407 days from conception (42 days incubation + 365 days of age) and yield 1,800kg of meat, 50 m2 of leather and 36kg of feathers each year.”<br /><br /><b>By: Steve Agbota</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "To attract more investments in agribusiness, governments must open up the space for smallholder farmers, ensure sufficient fund is provided for research and intensify efforts to remove investment bottlenecks.<br /><br />This was the submission of investors at the Plenary on Edo Agro-industrial Revolution and Agribusiness Transformation at the Alaghodaro Investment Summit, in Benin City, Edo State on Friday.<br /><br />The discussion leader and Chairman, PRESCO Plc., Felix Nwabuko, said the agriculture is still bedeviled by myriad of challenges, such as lack of access to finance, land acquisition, infrastructure, community clashes amongst others.<br /><br />According to him, “All of these have serious impact on agribusiness. Some of the issues that exist include climatic variations, which Edo State is thankfully not susceptible to. But chief of the challenges that have bedeviled the system is the inadequate research as well as the low utilisation of mechanised tools.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3N-k3zNuLSQ/Wga_OSPjnxI/AAAAAAAAAtI/FGBjCUgN3XUKa_5dTKBVO9FL3y4QINdFACLcBGAs/s1600/EDO%2BDAN.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"255\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"198\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-3N-k3zNuLSQ/Wga_OSPjnxI/AAAAAAAAAtI/FGBjCUgN3XUKa_5dTKBVO9FL3y4QINdFACLcBGAs/s320/EDO%2BDAN.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He added that Edo State is home to four federal research institutes but stressed that he has not really benefited from them, adding, “I don’t think any state can ask for any better. But these institutes are underfunded and lack basic infrastructure. However, they need to develop tools and products that can attract private sector investment.<br /><br />Businesses will be happy to define research focus for the institutes.” Noting that there is need to change the trend, he said, “The case going forward, shouldn’t be about planting more hectares, but in getting more from the same plot of land. To make the best in agriculture, we need to allow markets to drive agriculture. We need to encourage businesses to produce competitively.”<br /><br />Rasheed Sarumi said that the SARO Agro Services was working to actualise the state government’s vision to create jobs and engage youths through agriculture, adding, “We are using market-led approach to agriculture in Edo State.<br /><br />The arrangement is that we would buy what the people produce and we are to provide them with inputs and training.” He added that the firm initially ran into initial glitches because youths didn’t apply to be part of its out-grower scheme.<br /><br />“Each of the outgrowers, who are youths, are to own a 5-hectare farm and employ 50 others. We intend to process maize into feeds in Edo State. Though we are starting with maize, we are moving to other crops.”<br /><br />&nbsp;Adhi Narto of Dufil said that the company has been in Nigeria in the last 20 years, but the investments in Edo State is part of deepening the company’s backward integration strategy. He said, “We are concerned about efficiency. Though we have issues with infrastructure, we believe they are teething problems.<br /><br />We want to make Edo State a hub for our investments in Nigeria. This is because from our insight, the sales in Edo State is three times more of what we make nationwide.<br /><br />The President, Association of Edo Farmers, Chief Emmanuel Odigie, said that farmers in the state face a number of challenges and urged Federal and State governments to work in synergy to address them. He said 80 per cent of arable land in the state in the forest stage, noting that the state government should intensify efforts to change the narrative.<br /><br /><b>Source: Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL) on Thursday signed an agricultural mechanization management contract with the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI) and Machine and Equipment Consortium Africa (MECA) to boost agri-business.<br /><br />The synergy involves NIRSAL providing 75 per cent credit guarantee to enable NASENI and MECA repair 10,000 grounded tractors littered in various parts of Nigeria.<br /><br />Speaking at the stakeholders’ concept forum in Abuja Thursday where the repair contract was signed, the Managing Director of NIRSAL, Aliyu Abdulhameed, described the deal as a “tractorisation project in which 10,000 abandoned tractors would be repaired annually”.<br /><br />“For an average price of (let’s say) N12 million naira (the cost of a tractor), that will amount to about N120 billion worth of equipment that needs to be serviced. The deal would rake in N1.2 trillion into the Nigerian economy in 10 years”, he revealed.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oBF3H9bRr2Y/WgW9GMyqUhI/AAAAAAAAAs4/pWh2n3t-oBEzPN_NybCgs75NhC1HPicTQCLcBGAs/s1600/Dr%2BKalu%2B%252C%2Bon%2Ba%2BTractor.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"199\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oBF3H9bRr2Y/WgW9GMyqUhI/AAAAAAAAAs4/pWh2n3t-oBEzPN_NybCgs75NhC1HPicTQCLcBGAs/s1600/Dr%2BKalu%2B%252C%2Bon%2Ba%2BTractor.jpg\" /></a></div><br />According to him, every tractor to be repaired will be financed through the banks to the tune of N1.5 million, with NIRSAL providing up to 75 per cent of the guarantees.<br /><br />“Already, 11 workshops are being built across the country to commence the tractor repair exercise nationwide”, he noted.<br /><br />Abdulhameed, who described the project as one that would transform Nigeria’s agricultural sector from the 19th to the 21st century, pointed out that it represents a giant leap for the mechanisation of agricultural value chain in Nigeria.<br /><br />The NIRSAL boss, however, lamented the poor maintenance culture of Nigerians, saying it was responsible for the high number of unserviceable tractors and other carcasses of mechanised farm equipment littered across the country. He said: “We have a serious problem in this country which can only be solved by cultivating a good maintenance culture.<br /><br />“Statistics have shown that tractors do not last more than 12 months in Nigeria and after 12 months it goes into disuse. When nothing is further done to revive them, they gather dust and become obsolete.<br /><br />“Our mandate is to provide an enabling environment for commercial banks to lend money to farmers and those that want to purchase tractors. Mind you, an average tractor costs N12million.<br /><br />“Meanwhile, an average lifespan of a contractor for maximum productivity is between 25 to 30 years of purchase. Also, tractors work in prepared piece of land. So using a tractor for another purpose for which it was not made for is another problem.<br /><br />“More so, the lack of effective business system is another setback for the country.<br /><br />“For us to wriggle out of this problem and make farming attractive for all, we must train professionals to man various areas,” he explained.<br /><br />Abdulhameed further stressed that a tractor, ideally, was supposed to service three hectares of land, adding that fixing them would create over 35,000 jobs for technicians, mechanics, drivers, among others.<br /><br />Giving further insight into the project, he said, “it speaks for the primary production mechanisation particularly tractorisation and the density of tractor services in Nigeria agricultural primary production space.”<br /><br />“NISAL is providing 75 per cent guarantee to the total amount that is required to be able to service 10,000 tractors every year for the next 10 years.<br /><br />He described this as a big market, adding that the contract between NIRSAL on one hand and NASENI and MECA on the other represented a business-driven partnership.<br /><br />Abdulhameed stated NASENI would be providing the technical support for the project, which is to cover the 36 states of the federation and Abuja.<br /><br />He disclosed that the ultimate beneficiaries of the project were the states, noting that a move to get the states through their agriculture ministries for expression of interest was imminent.<br /><br />NIRSAL, NASENI and MECA field team will soon jumpstart a census exercise to take an inventory of tractors that would come on the project, he said.<br /><br /><b>By: Uche Usim and Obi Okwe,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Nigeria Incentive-based Risk Sharing system said it would begin the implementation of a partnership with the Machine and Equipment Consortium Africa, and the National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure that would see the addition of fresh N1.4tn to Nigeria’s Gross Domestic Product.<br /><br />The Managing Director of NIRSAL, Mr. Aliyu Abdulhameed, while speaking in Abuja during the unveiling of the initiative, said NIRSAL would be committing about 75 per cent of its balance sheet to guarantee mechanisation of agricultural value chain in Nigeria.Under the new scheme, he said NIRSAL would provide 75 per cent guarantee to the sum of N120bn required to finance and service 10,000 tractors annually.<br /><br />Abdulhameed, who described the project as one that would move the nation’s agricultural sector from the 19th to the 21st century, said it represented a giant leap for the mechanisation of agricultural value chain in Nigeria.<br /><br />He said NIRSAL would be implementing the project in partnership with the Machine and Equipment Consortium Africa and National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure.<br /><br />He said the goal was to trigger an agricultural industrialisation process through increased production and processing of the greater part of what was produced to boost economic earnings across the value chain.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UZZL8llMS6s/WgW5IBvyqoI/AAAAAAAAAss/-01FlyqgJJId_diadtlhCYQvySYucBEHwCLcBGAs/s1600/MD%2BNIRSAL.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"442\" data-original-width=\"762\" height=\"185\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-UZZL8llMS6s/WgW5IBvyqoI/AAAAAAAAAss/-01FlyqgJJId_diadtlhCYQvySYucBEHwCLcBGAs/s320/MD%2BNIRSAL.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />According to him, the project is born out of NIRSAL’s concern that there are just approximately 6.5 tractors for every 100 square kilometres of arable land in Nigeria as against the global average of 200 tractors for every 100 square kilometres.<br /><br />He said most of the tractors, which had gone bad, were not being repaired despite the country’s huge need for mechanised farming.<br /><br />Quoting available statistics, he said Nigeria needed a minimum of 10,000 tractors each year for the next ten years for any visible impact to be made in primary production in agriculture.<br /><br />He said that the practice of allowing the tractors to go into a state of disrepair within six months to 12 months after purchase would do grave harm to the government’s efforts to develop agriculture.<br /><br />He said, “If Nigeria requires 10,000 tractors every&nbsp; year for the next ten years in order to meet the global average of 200 tractors for every 100 square kilometres, it means that each of those tractors doing an average of three hectares per day for 120 days, we will end up doing 3.6 million hectares.<br /><br />“And this, at an average yield of four tonnes of hectares of grain will result in about 1.2 million metric tonnes of grain, with at an average price of 100,000 per metric tonnes of grain will result in over N1tn equivalent that we will add to this economy.”<br /><br /><b>By: Ifeanyi Onuba,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "FG Goes Tough On Rice Smugglers",
    "content": "<br />The federal government has adopted certain strict measures to check against smuggling of rice into the country.<br /><br />Minister of Agriculture Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, who gave the hint yesterday, said the federal government is seeking ways to ensure that the Memorandum of Understanding (M0U) Nigeria signed with its neighbouring countries to check smuggling is implemented.<br /><br />Speaking shortly after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting, Ogbeh said the federal government has read the riot act to smugglers, saying it will no longer tolerate their activities.<br /><br />He said, “The other issue was the question of smuggling. In Mr. President’s speech to the National Assembly yesterday, he gave very strong warning about smugglers who bring in unauthorised commodities through the unauthorised borders into the country.<br /><br />“We have to deal with that because, while we are making a great deal of progress in our grains productions, smugglers are busy compromising the success we have achieved.<br /><br />“Between September 2015 and now, rice importation through the ports has dropped from 644,131 tones to 20,000 tonnes in September this year. This means that by the early part of next year, we can literally say that we are close to total self-sufficiency in rice.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VatTNy97eyc/WdzV7JOemHI/AAAAAAAAASk/w5y21R6zf_QhV5U6hRDMq1c7ApL0nlrRwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Chief-Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VatTNy97eyc/WdzV7JOemHI/AAAAAAAAASk/w5y21R6zf_QhV5U6hRDMq1c7ApL0nlrRwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Chief-Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“On the other hand, to the West of Nigeria, rice importation has increased to 1.33m tones at the Republic of Benin. They don’t eat parboiled rice but the white rice. So, every grain of rice landing there is heading for Nigeria through illegal smuggling.<br /><br />“Some of it also comes in through Niger Republic. These are issues we have to deal with because we are creating jobs through our local rice production. There are 12.2 million rice farmers in the country now.<br /><br />Asked on specific actions the government is taking to tackle smuggling, the minister recalled that there was MoU between Nigeria and Republic of Benin entered into when former President Obasanjo was in office.<br /><br />He noted that the two countries will work together in ensuring that each other’s interest is not compromised.<br /><br />According to him, while the MoU has not been implemented fully, federal government is going to take it up.<br /><br />Ogbeh added that already, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has been working with the committee which he heads and he is working with the Minister of Finance, Comptroller General of Customs and the ministry of Agriculture.<br /><br />He also disclosed that FEC has given approval for the development of foundation seeds for maize to the Institute of Agricultural Research, Ahmadu Bello University (ABU) Zaria.<br /><br />He pointed out that one of the challenges is that because Nigeria does not have the right variety of seeds, the yield per hector is very poor, even as he noted that the country has the lowest in the world.<br /><br />“So, that research is going on and the fund is N155 million for 30 tonnes of foundation to multiply to 230 tonnes of improved seeds which will be given to seed companies to multiply”, he added.<br /><br />The minister also gave reasons why Nigeria is yet to achieve self-sufficiency in rice and why the price of rice has not crashed as earlier projected.<br /><br />He explained: “I was in the largest mill in the country in Kano two days ago. They were selling rice for N15,000 per 50kg. You know your country very well; there are middlemen who do all kinds of things and I told the millers to increase the number of their distributors because there is no point saying it is N15,000 in their factory when out there, somebody is hoarding.<br /><br />“The same thing happened to maize. Some people filled their warehouses with maize and shut the place so that the prices were so high that poultry farmers could not get access to maize in the market. So, people went to import, crash the prices and they started complaining. There is nowhere rice is selling for N20,000.<br /><br />&nbsp;Also, the federal government has approved the sum of N5 billion naira for the third quarter soil control acceleration for the different geopolitical zones in the country.<br /><br />This was disclosed by the special adviser media to the president on media and publicity, Femi Adesina, after the Federal Executive Council meeting presided over by President Muhammadu Buhari at the Presidential Villa.<br /><br />He was joined at the briefing by the Minister of agriculture, Audu Ogbeh and Minister of State, Aviation, Hadi Sirika.<br /><br />Adesina said, “Let me start by saying that the third quarter soil controlled acceleration has been approved for the different geopolitical places in the country. This will be in Kano, Sokoto South local government, Ondo, Osun, Enugu and Bayelsa States. The total for the Soil Erosion Controlled accelerated project is N5.567, 314,541.76 only.<br /><br />In his briefing, Sirika said as part of efforts to connect every Nigerian engaged in trade and commerce to business, FEC approved bilateral air services agreements between Nigeria and the State of Canada.<br /><br />He said this would open businesses, connect culture, trade and commerce between Canada and Nigeria.<br /><br /><b>By Jonathan Nda- Isaiah,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The President Animal Care Konsult,&nbsp; Dr.&nbsp; Olatunde Agbato,&nbsp; has identified wrong market perception of white eggs as major reason why poultry farmers in the country don’t grow birds that lay such eggs.<br /><br />Dr. Agbato,&nbsp; who spoke at the ongoing Poultry Show in Abeokuta, regretted that stakeholders in the industry have also failed to invest in educating the public on the issues which lead to the significant drop in the demand for white eggs due to low social appeal.<br /><br />He said the most efficient egg laying breeds (Isa White) are not being used in Nigeria because they lay white eggs for which many Niegerians have negative perception.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KlJKOTifBxk/WgQhwOwSGbI/AAAAAAAAAsM/0x76dX_-qw0mDEBNb4QyF3zQIv6E-AYQQCLcBGAs/s1600/White%2BEgg.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-KlJKOTifBxk/WgQhwOwSGbI/AAAAAAAAAsM/0x76dX_-qw0mDEBNb4QyF3zQIv6E-AYQQCLcBGAs/s320/White%2BEgg.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Dr. Agbato,&nbsp; however,&nbsp; dismissed such perception, saying white eggs are equal to brown eggs in terms of quality and wholesomeness.<br /><br />He said some breeds that lay white eggs are of relatively higher feed efficiency and performance in hot weather than brown breeds that are also able to lay brown eggs.<br /><br />Dr.&nbsp; Agbato also advised farmers to pay increasing attention to science behind production of their seed stock.<br /><br />“This is very important based on the final objectives for establishing the poultry.&nbsp; Some breeds are heavier than some others, while some breeds perform better than some others. Some breeds consume high quantity of feed,&nbsp; while some consume relatively less quantity of feed,” he said.<br /><br />Dr Agbato said the market ultimately determines the type of breed to be invested in but added that the market may not always choose the most efficient breed which could be disadvantageous to farmers lacking the scale.<br /><br /><b>By Hussein Yahaya,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Early hoarding activities may affect the market supply and price of soybeans this year as harvest begins in earnest in Katsina State.<br /><br />Over the years, soybeans has enjoyed industrial demands for the extraction of edible oil, milk, poultry and other animal feeds; but the cultivation of the crop has significantly reduced this year as farmers in the state concentrated in massive cultivation of maize and rice.<br /><br />Malam Umar Aliyu, a large scale soybeans farmer in Malumfashi, told Daily Trust that the market supply of the produce would be low this year which might result to the push in its price higher than that of last year.<br /><br />“Mass cultivation of rice and maize has this year affected the volume of soybeans production in this state; and its demand increases yearly due to increase in the number of poultry farms, edible oil refineries and animal feed firms across the country.<br /><br />“These are enough reasons to expect a push in the price of the produce compared to last year,” said Umar Aliyu.<br /><br />He added that entrepreneurs have started hoarding the produce so that they supply companies at <br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4PkKNsjIUc/WgQgr3fSzbI/AAAAAAAAAr8/VQzXgltr-lgwbSbc9gVE3NfYN_2UixVzwCLcBGAs/s1600/Soya%2BBeans%2BDemand.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Z4PkKNsjIUc/WgQgr3fSzbI/AAAAAAAAAr8/VQzXgltr-lgwbSbc9gVE3NfYN_2UixVzwCLcBGAs/s320/Soya%2BBeans%2BDemand.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>higher prices later.<br /><br />“Before, companies through their agents bought soybeans and other grains directly from farmers in open markets, a situation that was of immense benefit to the farmers who sold their produce at a high prices.<br /><br />“This year, entrepreneurs are buying it from farmers at a low price of N12,000 for onward selling to companies in a few weeks’ time. This development would starve our markets of the produce and farmers would be prevented from getting optimal returns from their investment,” Aliyu said.<br /><br />He further stated that some years ago, hoarding of soybeans only started after companies have finished purchasing the produce in the November/December.<br /><br />Efforts to speak with some of the entrepreneurs by this reporter proved abortive as they declined to comment on the alleged hoarding of the produce while some claimed that they were agents of some companies.<br /><br />A farmer in Dayi, Sani Nalado, said besides hoarding, farmers were also threatened by theft on their farms.<br /><br />“Even with the tedious process of harvesting soybeans, farmers this year stand a risk of produce theft at farms considering its low supply and high market price. That is why we are now more vigilant,” said Nalado.<br /><br />He added that the prospects of soybeans this year was much higher than that of the last two years especially as its price started on a good note of&nbsp; N12,000.<br /><br />A check in Kafur and Dayi markets by Daily Trust revealed that unlike last year when the price of the produce started from N10,500, this year it ranges from N12,000 - N13,000 depending on its maturity, quality and variety.<br /><br />But not many of the farmers appear to be in a hurry to sell everything; instead some are storing it at home to study the market behaviour regarding the produce.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmud,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "What Nigeria Can Learn from Kenyan Seed Industry – Expert",
    "content": "<br />You have worked extensively across Africa and have better understanding of the continent’s seed industry; how will you describe access to quality seeds by many farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa?<br /><br />Access to quality seeds is still a challenge to many farmers because of cost and because of various climatic differences. In some countries, accessing quality seeds is stifled by inadequate supply, in others it is inhibited by unwillingness to buy seeds. Many farmers in Africa still rely on their own seeds thereby making uptake of seeds to be very low in Africa. New varieties are hardly taken up by farmers because of lack of knowledge of what the varieties can do in an environment littered with poor perception about breeder seeds. African farmers’ uptake of new varieties stands at about 25 per cent.<br /><br /><b>Reports from Kenya indicate that the seed industry is better organised. How did the East African country achieve that?</b><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ2jDNqqoaU/WfwwHEbiZwI/AAAAAAAAAoU/_LmONZq9yC8h7CO4dc7XWFOxukw1LeBrQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Rich%2BNatural%2BCocoa%2Bin%2BWest%2BAfrica.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"394\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ2jDNqqoaU/WfwwHEbiZwI/AAAAAAAAAoU/_LmONZq9yC8h7CO4dc7XWFOxukw1LeBrQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Rich%2BNatural%2BCocoa%2Bin%2BWest%2BAfrica.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Countries like Kenya have farmers who have resorted to commercial farming. They need quality seeds, so they buy because the return on investment is assured. Seed companies, therefore, have to up their game because of a ready market.<br /><br />Secondly, seed business is very active because the three countries depend on each other: Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania. Kenya is, however, leading because of the amount of investment the government puts in seed production through the giant Kenya Seed Company and the robust research work being carried out by the Kenya Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (KALRO).<br /><br /><b>Can you briefly tell us about the event that brought you to Nigeria?</b><br /><br />We came to sensitise the seed companies in Nigeria on the benefits of the GM technology. We also came to share with them issues of bio-safety and regulations. This is because researchers do their work for seed companies who must sell to the farmers. If they do not understand the technology, they will reject it. Hence we met and discussed which way they should take. I am happy to report that a majority of seed companies have accepted the technology and were able to speak out in public today to say, the moment now is the moment of biotechnology.<br /><br /><b>Do you think it is high time Africa embraced biotech?</b><br /><br />As it were, the answer is yes. We have chalenges with our soils, with climate change, with seeds, water, name it, yet the population is growing so fast.<br /><br />With more mouths to feed, we need better yields and better quality seeds which biotech guarantees us. This does not mean that we do away with conventional breeding, never: because the two complement each other.<br /><br /><b>What do you think has been the major issue with people accepting GM seeds across Africa?</b><br /><br />Acceptance has been low, but it is improving. Two major factors are responsible for our fortunes: these are the negative publicity from Europe and in communication. Negative news sells better than positive news. Europe is fighting America in this technology: it is more of a trade war than a scientific war.<br /><br />The other factor is that African governments have not taken bold steps to thumb their authority and position on the GM technology. They need to provide a conducive environment for the take off of the GM revolution.<br /><br /><b>How can Nigeria learn from the Kenyan seed industry?</b><br /><br />Nigeria needs to invest in seed production. They need to look at farming as commerce and not as a way of subsistence by the way.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

Most poultry farmers could not even recover production costs not to talk of making profit then, and this is what we are still facing,” he said.<br /><br />He advocated for the establishment of a poultry produce board that would be buying poultry produce from local farmers during glut and sell same during scarcity as it was done for other farm produce in the olden days.<br /><br />Another farmer, Mrs. Kenmat Abiola of Zarmik Farms in Abeokuta, also mentioned high cost of feeds as a major challenge facing the industry, adding that even though they produced their feeds locally; sourcing for the raw materials was an issue.<br /><br />“Most of these raw materials are being imported and because of the Forex scarcity, their prices are high. The fact is that we are only managing to remain in the business; it is basically not easy,” she said.<br /><br />Another participant identified workers’ sincerity as one of the challenges facing the industry, saying because some owners hardly visited their farms; unscrupulous workers usually stole poultry produce like eggs to the detriment of the owners.<br /><br />The theme of this year’s show is “Efficiency in Production as a Tool to Survive a Recession in the Poultry Industry.’<br /><br /><b>By Hussein Yahaya</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Umahi for his accomplishment in the provision of infrastructure in the state, and described him as “a child who has learnt to eat with elders.”<br /><br />In his remarks, Umahi thanked the former president and the Zero Hunger Forum, for convening the meeting in the state and pledged to renew his commitment to attain zero hunger in the state and country at large.<br /><br />“The benefits of the zero hunger agenda are unquantifiable, and we thank President Muhammdu Buhari for his avid commitment towards agriculture, which Ebonyi has benefited greatly.<br /><br />“Ebonyi used to find it difficult in the past to effectively harness its agricultural and mineral resources potential, but the president, vice president, ministers of agriculture and finance, among others, have assisted us greatly,” he said.<br /><br />Gov. Samuel Ortom of Benue, who also spoke, said Benue was ready to support Ebonyi and other states with its expertise in livestock farming and hatchery.<br /><br />Other states in the pilot project of Zero Hunger Forum are Benue, Ogun, Kebbi, Sokoto and Borno.<br /><br />(NAN)<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

You can yell loud about Bt.-Cotton now.&nbsp; Farmers keep talking about good seeds, they mostly lament that when cotton starts growing, it then literally vanishes”, he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VatTNy97eyc/WdzV7JOemHI/AAAAAAAAASk/w5y21R6zf_QhV5U6hRDMq1c7ApL0nlrRwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Chief-Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"300\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"240\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-VatTNy97eyc/WdzV7JOemHI/AAAAAAAAASk/w5y21R6zf_QhV5U6hRDMq1c7ApL0nlrRwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Chief-Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“We need to cut down importation and increase export, our country is coming out of recession but there are serious challenges coming up. Our economy is growing at the rate of 3.2 %, the economy needs to perform at 6.7%, otherwise we cannot say there is growth.<br /><br />In the next 3-4years, our population will be 200 million and 450million by 2050, this is scary, so what we are doing now is little compared to what we need to do”, he added.<br /><br />He disclosed that there is no substitute to science research, “we cannot change anything without serious work and I am very happy I am seeing this because there has been a lot of negative talk about Bt., we will join hands with you to demystify the myth around this technology”.<br /><br />During the tour, Professor Isa Onu of IAR Zaria explained to the minister that the fruiting from BtCotton reaches 80 to 120 fruits which cannot be compared to our cotton which is always grappling to survive the attack of bollworm and thus ends up dropping the fruiting points to survive.<br /><br />“As a scientist, I am not condemning our cotton but we have to say the truth, you can see, Bt.-Cotton and our cotton is planted here side by side, bollworm is eating up our cotton but you can see that Bt. Cotton is doing well without attack from bollworm”, Prof. Onu.<br /><br />Similarly, the DG/CEO, NABDA Professor Lucy Ogbadu applauded the Minister for the visit as the visit will encourage the scientists to do more in order to bring Nigeria out of recession. She said she was happy that the Minister had seen the technology working himself without being told.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

For example, if hatchery produces quality chicks and somebody somewhere along the line messes up the product, the farmer will not get the desired result. That is why as stakeholders, all of us need to come together and ensure that all the best practices are adhered to at all time”.<br /><br />He further stated that stakeholders must be enlightened about what it takes to produce quality chicks and operate within that realm. “For instance, what concerns me most as an hatchery opertor is to ensure that I work within the acceptable parameters that gives us good result and moreso to be security conscious about the operation.<br /><br />“If my environment is dirty, a lot of organisms are build up then the product will be affected. So that is what concerns me as an hatchery operator. Concerning transportation also, there are accepatble temperature range that must be complied with for chicks to survive. But if such condition is not met, the quality of the chicks will be affected. So that is why we keep saying that it does not end with the production, it goes along also to other handlers”.<br /><br />Adewole, however suggested that stakeholders must come together to educate transporters about the condtions they have to meet in order to ensure the safety of day old chicks before getting to the final destination.<br /><br />Chairman, Day Old Chick Merchants Association of Nigeria, Oluyole branch, Alhaji Oyetunde Asimiyu, while speaking with the Nigerian Tribune said the seminar was put together to broaden the knowledge of members on the cruxes that will orchestrate the process of having quality day old chicks.<br /><br /><b>By Nurudeen Alimi&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

During our meeting, we did an analytical appraisal of the situation and we have come out with a strong active points that must be implemented urgently.<br /><br />“One of such measures is to immediately institute a mediation team comprising the security operatives, the Fulani community, and my special adviser on non-indigene affairs as well as the leader of Hausa/Fulani community in the state.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3zfuTZWLD0g/WgF8CmsFMrI/AAAAAAAAAp8/-frXy03u20kPwvpHSHTEnlFSMhtfHejuQCLcBGAs/s1600/Ben%2BAyade.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"183\" data-original-width=\"276\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-3zfuTZWLD0g/WgF8CmsFMrI/AAAAAAAAAp8/-frXy03u20kPwvpHSHTEnlFSMhtfHejuQCLcBGAs/s1600/Ben%2BAyade.jpg\" /></a></div><br />The governor admitted that Benue State’s anti-grazing law has put a lot of pressure on Cross River, particularly along border communities and towns.<br /><br />“If the Federal Government does not come to lend its support to the state, what will happen is that they are leaving the farmers and the herdsmen to take on themselves.”<br /><br />Ayade said due to the implementation of the anti-open grazing law by Benue government, “there has been an exodus of Fulani herdsmen to Cross River.<br /><br />“This has become more exacerbated by the changes in climatic condition as the grasses up North are getting dryer and the impact is what resulted in the incident we recorded yesterday where there was a skirmish between the herdsmen and Ugaga community, leading to loss of life.<br /><br />“If Cross River does nothing, the continuous exodus of uncontrolled number of herdsmen into the state will result in more crisis.<br /><br />“So, we must do something actively and fast, too, because it is causing anxiety, fear and worry and all through Sunday night, the calls and suggestions I got were that we should follow the direction of Benue state.”<br /><br />“We, in Cross River, have lived with the herdsmen peacefully over time but obviously, with the passage of the Anti-Open-Grazing Law and its full implementation in Benue, it is having its effect on us. Currently, the situation is where the farmers feel a deep sense of loss with the continuous grazing on their economic crops while the herdsmen are desperately searching for pastures to sustain their cattle.<br /><br /><br /><br />“I urge the federal government to summon the courage and tackle the issue because if all the states pass a stiff law against grazing, then we are wiping out that trade and source of livelihood of some persons and if on the other hand, we also do nothing, and they continue to wipe out the crops, then you are also wiping out the source of living of another set of people.<br /><br />“At this juncture, it is wise for us to call on the federal government to live up to its responsibilities by responding adequately to the plight of the people affected by the menace of herdsmen across the country.”<br /><br />Commissioner of Police, Hafiz Inuwa, who confirmed that one life was lost in the clash with one injured, disclosed that his men have been mobilised to the scene and added that the security of the area was under control.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

They came up with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), again, to last another 15 years. This time, they have more goals than they had in the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).<br /><br />“First one is elimination of poverty; second one is zero hunger; third one health and then the world food programme represented here. We thought that we should just have these goals without making efforts to do something about them collectively and individually, country by country.<br /><br />“So, I was approached and agreed that we will work out detailed plans, programmes, and strategies to achieve zero hunger by the year 2030 in Nigeria. So, that is how the zero hunger project started” he said.<br /><br />In his speech, host governor, David Umahi, said his government is making spirited effort to ensure it achieves targets in agriculture, which would help to reduce hunger.<br /><br />Six governors: Rotimi Akeredolu, Ondo;&nbsp; Samuel Ortom, Benue; Ibikunle Amosun, Ogun; Abubakar Atiku Bagudu, Kebbi, Aminu Waziri Tambuwal, Sokoto and Kashim Shetima of Borno states were expected but as at yesterday, only&nbsp; Ortom and Shetima, represented by his deputy, were present.<br /><br />In Enugu State, Obasanjo expressed delight with Governor Ifeanyi Ugwuanyi’s commitment towards the socio-economic development of the South East.<br /><br />He said&nbsp; the governor has “surprised me.”<br /><br />Obasanjo said this when he led a delegation of Brenthurst Foundation to the Government House, Enugu, and recalled that during the South East Security and Economic Summit in the state, last December, “Ugwuanyi made a wonderful planning that saw to the success of the programme.<br /><br />“That exercise from that day, took a life of its own and I thought we need to give you (Ugwuanyi)&nbsp; a highest commendation for that.”<br /><br />The former President also noted that the success of the summit gave birth to the South East Region Development Company (SEREDEC).<br /><br />He applauded South East governors for working together for the development of the zone, and stressed the importance of education, economy and social welfare of the people as the basic ingredients of such growth.<br /><br />Brenthurst Foundation, which has Obasanjo as chairman and Dr. Greg Mills as chief executive, is brainchild of the Oppenheimer Family of South Africa, initiated for the economic development of Africa.<br /><br />The foundation was recently invited by the South East Governors’ Forum to explore the region’s potentials for economic integration and development of the zone.<br /><br />He disclosed that the Foundation’s vision was to assess the needs of the people of the zone in the areas of economy, infrastructure, transportation, power, housing, agriculture, among others, and think of how to impact positively on what is already being done in the region, bearing in mind the federal government plans.<br /><br />The former president said that the foundation is not into politics, but that its focus is purely to assist in the development of Africa, in appreciation of the fortunes the family made in the continent.<br /><br />In his welcome address, Ugwuanyi paid glowing tribute to Obasanjo&nbsp; for his passion for the development of the zone, and added that the success story of the foundation informed the south east states’ decision to explore a working relationship with it.<br /><br /><b>By: Lauds Ugwuanyi,</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Agriculture and the Future of Africa",
    "content": "<br />Africa is continent of 55 countries and thousands of nationalities with incredible human and cultural diversity. Anthropologists have long associated the prevalence of human and cultural diversity with biological, ecological, ecosystem and agricultural biodiversity. Africa is an outstanding evidence of that concordance.&nbsp; In addition to its wealth of incredible diversity, Africa is the youngest and fastest growing continent. In 2050, a quarter of the world’s people would be resident in Africa (2.5 billion). Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, would rank the world’s third. Over 70 per cent of Africans would be under 30 years of age! How can the continent harness this incredible potential which could readily flip into unprecedented tragedy if not well-managed? That is the big question for the future of Africa. That future is at the intersection of strength and a ticking time bomb.<br /><br />In a way, Africa’s future lies on the continent’s ability to capitalise on its strengths, to exploit its late-comer advantage in the development dynamic. A few of those strengths and their intersections include the continent’s population and youth power; its traditional knowledge and the latter’s intersection with technologies, all of which have ramifications for agriculture as a crucial sector for the continent’s political and economic stability.<br /><br />As a starting point, Africa must be able to feed itself. In doing so, it must creatively engage its youth and leverage the continent’s value-added in the global market place by interfacing information communication technologies with agro production and marketing. The need to fill the gap between youth power and the continent’s ability to feed itself needs no emphasis. Most political ruptures in history from the historical bred riots to fairly recent Arab Spring have been linked to the frustrations of a hungry population which is inevitably an angry population.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OFqRZcXhvrQ/WgBDcHmg8_I/AAAAAAAAAo4/ODP5ZSH1zyo-L-W9gIPX6kXbfaY-8jXmACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Women%2Bin%2BAgriculture.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"464\" data-original-width=\"696\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OFqRZcXhvrQ/WgBDcHmg8_I/AAAAAAAAAo4/ODP5ZSH1zyo-L-W9gIPX6kXbfaY-8jXmACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Women%2Bin%2BAgriculture.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />But development experts construct Africa, as they do of world’s indigenous peoples, as in a desperate need for “capacity building and capacity development” in virtually all areas including agriculture. They are wont to recommend orthodox solutions. Hardly any regard is given to what the rest could learn from Africa. For example, they prescribe hi-tech/industrial agriculture as the solution to Africa’s food insecurity. Now, the entire country, including Nigeria is in a race to the bottom over the introduction of genetically modified organism as the prime gift of agro-biotechnology to be uncritically embraced. But “experts” are silent on the cost of that approach or the overall industrial agriculture option on the continent.<br /><br />In a counterintuitive way, these uncritical advocates of capacity building and capacity development are themselves in need of inward capacity development to understand Africa’s realities. Hi-tech agricultural has troubling legacies ill-suited for replication in Africa.&nbsp; Consider this: Since 1990s, we have lost 75 per cent of plant genetic resource diversity for food and agriculture. Today, 24 billion tonnes of healthy soil and 15 million trees are lost yearly; one third of the world’s agricultural land is degraded. The future of industrial agriculture beyond 60 years is bleak! Only 3-5 mega transnational agro-chemical corporations have monopoly over key economic crops; we rely on three – rice, maize and wheat – (out of an estimated 30,000) of those for 75 per cent of our calorie intake. For these mega agro transnational corporations, African is another market frontier for their investments.<br /><br />Africa’s case is different: At 874 million hectares, Africa has 60 per cent world’s fertile land. Of 600 million Africans engaged in farming, 80 per cent are women. They are smallholder farmers. They are, by default, organic farmers relying mainly on TK and agrobiodiversity. The costs of wholesale adoption of industrial agriculture include massive social disruption and displacement of rural populations, deforestation, and replacement of agrobiodiversity with monoculture. Those are already evident from developments across the continent from Cote d’Ivoire to Cameroon; Liberia to Ethiopia, for example. Other costs include degradation of soil quality, another race to the bottom in the form of foreign direct investment desperation in agriculture which has resulted in unconscionable massive agricultural land grab across the continent. Gradually in agriculture, we are at the risk of repeating what has happened in the pharmaceutical sector. There, R&amp;D priorities are set by the Big Pharma, with huge investments in medicines for the rich and diseases of the affluent as opposed to the needs of the poor and vulnerable. With Africa’s agriculture in the hands of agro-TNCs, R&amp;D agenda in agriculture will be far removed from Africa’s priorities and needs in agro-biodiversity and the sustainability of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices. That is not a viable pathway for the continent.<br /><br />Africa’s factor endowment in TK-driven agriculture sustains ‘the culture in agriculture’ as Africa’s way of life. The communal and cultural components of agriculture in Africa are the reason African agriculture resists being reduced to mere production line of industrial monoculture. Africa can lead the search for how best to integrate its agricultural traditions into a sustainable and winning business model. That would include selective and dynamic adaptation of technologies such as those relating to climate change adaptation and mitigation, not to mention irrigation (only four per cent of Africa’s agriculture benefits from irrigation technology) and the use of new ICTs for global market optimisation of Africa’s niche and value-added in crop diversity and organic production. Not only would ICT bridge the gap between farmers and sophisticated brokers in the global value chain, it would open untapped legitimate branding through trademarking options, geographical indications and other custom market options.&nbsp; Although it may feel like the genie is out of the bottle, African may yet resist being screwed by the global supply/value chain. Through internal self-sustaining investments in its areas of factor endowment, it may still avoid developmental havocs of advanced economies by re-thinking the prospects of agriculture for the continent’s future in a constructive manner in relation to the self-serving and conventional prescriptions of western development experts.<br /><br /><b>By: Chidi Oguamanam</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Gender Officer at the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) Office in Jigawa, Hajiya Aina’u Ibrahim, has called for the introduction of more gender policies to boost the productivity of women in agriculture.<br /><br />Ibrahim made the call while speaking with journalists in Dutse on Wednesday. She noted that women constituted 70 per cent of the labour force in the agricultural sector of the nation’s economy. She said that in spite of the vital roles of women in agricultural production, they had limited access to land and other resources.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OFqRZcXhvrQ/WgBDcHmg8_I/AAAAAAAAAo0/yovFy9K7DsY3x7qDWGgWNW8Qox9i5rpxwCLcBGAs/s1600/Women%2Bin%2BAgriculture.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"464\" data-original-width=\"696\" height=\"213\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OFqRZcXhvrQ/WgBDcHmg8_I/AAAAAAAAAo0/yovFy9K7DsY3x7qDWGgWNW8Qox9i5rpxwCLcBGAs/s320/Women%2Bin%2BAgriculture.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“History has shown that women constitute about 70 per cent of the workforce in the agricultural sector but they still do not have access to land and other resources or control over them. “In spite of the vital roles which women play in agriculture such as crop planting, fertiliser application, harvesting, crop threshing and packaging, among others, they still face serious challenges such as illiteracy and poverty,’’ she added.<br /><br />Ibrahim reiterated that women, who played prominent roles in all agricultural processes, were largely unable to access those services that could boost their productivity. “Surprisingly, if you go to our villages, you will find out that most of the farmlands owned by women there are possessed through inheritance.<br /><br />“You will, however, discover that the women either lease or lend the farmlands out, or sometimes they give the lands to their husbands to farm. “Very few of the women benefit from such farmlands through gayauna — a small portion of the land being cultivated for them by those they leased or lent out the farms to. “So, we are telling them that the time has passed for the women to be left behind or short-changed.<br /><br />Women should take full control of their farmlands and venture into agriculture. “I am sure that by so doing, it will lift them out of poverty and they will eventually become employers of labour, and not labourers,’’ she added.

    "content": "<br />The International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and&nbsp; &nbsp;University of Florida’s Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences (UF/IFAS),&nbsp; have signed an agreement to work together to fight hunger, poverty, and pollution in Africa. The agreement was signed in Des Moines, Iowa, United States (U.S).<br /><br />IITA’s Director-General, Nteranya Sanginga, signed the agreement on behalf of IITA. He did so after participating in a panel discussion organised by UF/IFAS on the Fall Armyworm’s threat to African food security.<br /><br />“IITA and UF/IFAS share a common approach to science. We see discovery as a source of solutions, a catalyst for action, and the foundation for international cooperation,” Sanginga said, adding that combining our expertise will accelerate inquiry and is expected to hasten the identification of solutions to address the fall armyworm problem.<br /><br />IITA is marking its 50th year as an agricultural research institute working with international partners to improve livelihoods and nutrition, and preserve natural resources. UF/IFAS celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2014.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9_L9esrrZxE/WezfrEVRMJI/AAAAAAAAAgs/62IIO_6aQV0AQ5iX5JLeO7yZ4qk2L5HWQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/IITA.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"197\" data-original-width=\"255\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-9_L9esrrZxE/WezfrEVRMJI/AAAAAAAAAgs/62IIO_6aQV0AQ5iX5JLeO7yZ4qk2L5HWQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/IITA.png\" /></a></div><br />Sanginga is a founding member of the Fall Armyworm Science Advisory Board that UF/IFAS convened in Iowa. The Board seeks to combat the rapid spread of an insect that threatens maize crops on which 200 million Africans depend for food security.<br /><br />“UF/IFAS needs African expertise if it hopes to make a great impact on African challenges. Dr&nbsp; Sanginga and IITA are world renowned not only for their expertise, but for their willingness to share that expertise with other organisations,” Payne said.<br /><br />The five-year pact between IITA and UF/IFAS is a broad framework for cooperation. It lays the foundation for the identification and implementation of specific and joint scientific projects.<br /><br />“Africa has two great sources of appeal from a scientist’s point of view,” said Jack Payne, leader of UF/IFAS. “For one, it offers a great opportunity to put science to work improving lives.

    "title": "Transforming Food Production Through Technology",
    "content": "<br />Technology is making farming exciting. It is addressing many challenges of would-be farmers, DANIEL ESSIET reports.<br /><br />Technology is opening vast untapped potential for farmers, investors, and entrepreneurs to improve the efficiency of food production and consumption. From farming to promoting efficient food supply chain, technology is bringing major benefits to the sector.<br /><br />One organisation bringing change to agriculture is Growsel. This is because it offers opportunity to those looking to get involved in agriculture, an opportunity to invest in food production either as farmers or investors.<br /><br />Founded by digital entreprenuer, Mr. Jerry Oche, Growsel provides an online meeting point for investors and farmers to work towards a fruitful harvest, where the investor can get from between 15 and 30 per cent of his investment as profit. The farmers, on the other hand, can now have quick access to funds for their farming projects and get exposed to best global agricultural practices, as the company does not seem to be taking chances with quality and the implementation of standard farming practices.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L0eGL-GetrI/WdZD95Lh1DI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/XlCkJ3412b4R54r2wiZU69bAME3C_GApgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Picture%2B20.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"194\" data-original-width=\"259\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-L0eGL-GetrI/WdZD95Lh1DI/AAAAAAAAAKQ/XlCkJ3412b4R54r2wiZU69bAME3C_GApgCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Picture%2B20.jpg\" /></a></div>According to the company, prospective farmers, who registered at the platform, are&nbsp; screened to ensure that they meet up with the basic accreditation standards stipulated for every local farmer. Some of these include being a member of their local associations and getting a recommendation from other farmers, as well as the local ruler or chief. After a farmer has been approved and registered on the Growsel platform, insurance professionals from partner insurance companies will assess the farm and the appropriate insurance cover that would cover the risk exposure of the farm, and subsequently issues the farmer a policy. Growsel ensures that best practices are complied with by providing the farmers with improved seeds and seedlings, fertilisers, tractors and other farm inputs that would be needed to make the most of each farm project within a given farming season.<br /><br />Also, seeds are sourced from experts at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and are estimated to produce a certain amount of yield, which should guarantee increased returns for farmers and the investors’ profit. In addition, measures have been put in place to ensure that the investor gets the agreed profit, boasted that the seeds used for cultivation are of an enhanced variety.<br /><br />With over 150 farmers currently on the platform, and a pull of investors, Growsel is revolutionising agric business in Nigeria, and is still calling on more investors and farmers to join the process.<br /><br />When a farmer requests for funding once his registration is complete, the Growsel’s farm location managers moves out to carry out a proper verification of the farm and the farmer, during which an endorsement of the farmer by other farmers and local chiefs or leaders in the community where the particular farm is located, would be required.<br /><br />On the other hand, an intending investor would need to sign up on the platform, after which a welcome email would be sent to him or her. Once signed up, an investor can browse through the site to see which farm projects he/she would be interested in. A certificate, showing ownership of a particular farm project, will be issued to the investor once he/she selects a particular farm project to invest in. Afterwards, investors can monitor activities on their farm projects via their dashboards.<br /><br />The most interesting thing about all this is that with as low as 50,000 naira, anyone can be an investor on Growsel, with a guaranteed return on the investment at end of the crop cycle.<br /><br />FarmCrowdy is an agric-tech platform, which creates middle class Nigerians with small scale farms in order to boost food production.<br /><br />On how it works, partners on the platform can sponsor any farm of their choice including maize, poultry (broiler), cassava and tomato farms. The partners then get bi-weekly updates about their farm progress, including pictures and videos from the farmers. Also, Farm Partners can visit their farms if they wish to at any point in time to learn about the farmer they’ve partnered and the farm products they are working on. The organisation has a website that people can visit to buy off maize, rice, cassava, poultry farms. Investors can sponsor&nbsp; a farmer&nbsp; and up take the produce at the end of harvest.<br /><br />Chief Executive Officer, FarmCrowdy, Onyeka Akumah, explained that unlike the out grower model that gives input and allows farmers to just go and do all the work, what they&nbsp; do with the input is that the farmer gets money coming from the sponsors, so the sponsor holds them accountable to make sure that the farmer does the work. On their part, the organisation holds the farmers accountable to make sure they deliver what the off-taker wants, so that they can get harvest at the end of the day that the off-taker will buy, and then they will sell and pay the sponsors back in return for their money.<br /><br />According to him, his organisation is partnering International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and others to train farmers to farm while and improve yields.<br /><br />Right now, the organisation is handing sponsorship, which is the investment that goes into the farm and the production. The other area they are getting involved in is the logistics of moving the produce to the off-takers and the marketing of the value chain to off-takers.&nbsp; FarmCrowdy was launched in September last year. The company has attracted over 1000 farmers already.<br /><br />Akumah said the organisation has acquired&nbsp; &nbsp;500 hectares of maize farm in Jos, 280 hectares of rice farms in Edo State, Saboginda-Ora, among other investments.<br /><br />Another technology is Cellulant&nbsp; that worked with the Federal Government to launch an e-wallet programme to aid&nbsp; farmers directly redeem government subsidised seed and fertiliser vouchers from retail shops and in effect double their income.<br /><br />While Cellulant is “transforming” itself to a mobile payment company, Agrikore its agric-focused arm, monitors the implementation of agricultural schemes where every farmer can access financial services, productivity enhancing technologies &amp; best practices, access to markets for inputs and access to output markets, all enabled via the mobile phone.<br /><br />Co-Founder of Cellulant Corporation, Mr. Bolaji Akinboro, said the technology, which originated from&nbsp; Nigeria, is the gift of Cellulant to humanity. According to him, the&nbsp; technology gives small holder farmers access to agricultural inputs of improved varieties/breeds, fertiliser, and agro-chemicals, making it the backbone of increased productivity and profitability of value-added chains.<br /><br />After the success they&nbsp; recorded in Nigeria, Akinboro&nbsp; said the Afghanistan government gave Cellulant&nbsp; to introduce the e-wallet system to&nbsp; its small holder farmers.<br /><br />According to him, the&nbsp; e-wallet system provides a holistic system to link the farmers to agricultural inputs supply chain, finance and markets through integration with mobile network operators, input markets, extensions services, financial service providers, commodity market, and insurance service providers.”<br /><br />Since its launch in 2011, Cellulant’s E-wallet has facilitated the distribution of over $1 billion in fertiliser subsidies to farmers under the Growth Enhancement and Support (GES) programme, a component of the Agricultural Transformation Agenda (ATA) of the Federal Government of Nigeria.<br /><br />“Over and over again we have seen Africans, through various innovations, prove that the impossible is made possible when the needs of the consumers are at the centre of the solutions provided. GES is certainly a testimony to this. Delivery of a programme of this scale and at this speed is a first for Nigeria considering that the entire agro-dealer network had to be rebuilt from the scratch,”said Akinboro.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The African Development Bank (AfDB) and NEPAD Nigeria have agreed to collaborate with in the delivery of developmental programmes and projects would improve the welfare of the African people in line with NEPAD vision. In a statement on Sunday by the Special Assistant Media to the NEPAD CEO, Mr Nkem Anyata-Lafia, said that the agreement was reached in Abidjan, the Cote d’Ivoire capital, on October 31, 2017.<br /><br />According to NEPAD, the high point of the agreement was to further their collective aspirations for the development of the African continent, especially, in relation to food security and employment-creation. AfDB President, Dr. Akinwumi Adesina, said, although, Africa was late in its agricultural development agenda in comparison to other continents, there was hope that, with speedy actions, success would be achieved.<br /><br />Adesina emphasized the need to quicken actions on programmes on agricultural development in Africa in order to bridge the gap already created in that direction on the continent. He disclosed that the AfDB had identified what it calls ‘High 5 Priorities’ as quick wins that would enable the kind of growth that would be of immense benefits to the continent as a whole. Such areas include: To achieve this, Adesina said the AfDB has been reorganised for better delivery of its mandate and responsiveness to the needs of the African continent.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wJK7j9kZB4Y/WdcyTU-7qLI/AAAAAAAAAQY/Dx_2sxgL9eQiyB8LDu3yZutnkBRZR9mNwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AfDB.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"226\" data-original-width=\"223\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-wJK7j9kZB4Y/WdcyTU-7qLI/AAAAAAAAAQY/Dx_2sxgL9eQiyB8LDu3yZutnkBRZR9mNwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/AfDB.jpg\" /></a></div>He used the occasion to inform his audience that the Bank has adopted a new business model, which has also occasioned the establishment of three new Departments: Power, Energy and Green Growth; Agriculture, Human and Social Development as well as that of the Private Sector, Infrastructure and Industrialisation; each of which is headed by a Vice President. Adesina also informed the groups that the AfDB has, in its quest for increased efficiency in operations, established five Regional Integration and Business Delivery Offices across the continent.<br /><br />These offices, he said would be commissioned on November 19-20 this year adding that Nigeria has one of such Offices. As part of the areas of the Bank’s current investment focus, its President identified the Private Sector, Solar Energy, Agriculture, Youths and Women as areas of priority attention. He listed some programmes in relation to the aforementioned to include: 1 Grid-based System and Off the Grid System, which encompasses a 500m USD for facilitating business system for off the grid systems, efforts in clean energy for women and Africa 50, and a solar grid system being experimented in Jigawa State, Nigeria.<br /><br />Others include :1B USD signed between AfDB, World Bank, Rockefeller and Bill Gates Foundations for technologies in agricultural transformation and another 3B USD to support women in Africa; 25M USD for job- creation for African youth; 150Euro for Boost Africa, an initiative that will be carried out with European Investors; 300m USD for skills development as well as several other empowerment initiatives for the continent, including the oncoming African Investment Forum slated for Abidjan on November 8-9 this year.<br /><br />In her remarks, National Coordinator /CEO, NEPAD Nigeria, Princess Gloria Akobundu, extoled the “motivational leadership style” of Adesina. Akobundu called for stronger synergy in the activities of stakeholders in Africa’s development, while soliciting strong support from the AfDB for the programmes and projects of NEPAD Nigeria. She also used the occasion to promise collaboration with the Bank, while also regaling her audience with the challenges and achievements of NEPAD Nigeria since she assumed office.<br /><br />Also speaking, NEPAD Business Group, Nigeria, who is also President, Lagos State Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mrs Nike Akande, expressed gratitude to the AfDB boss for the reception accorded to the visiting Nigerian delegation. She used the opportunity to present the activities of the Group and its challenges, while promising to strive with NEPAD Nigeria to deliver the vision of a viable Africa on all areas of need. On his part, Chairman of NEPAD Business Group, Cote d’Ivoire, and President, International Cooperation in Africa, Nbengue Guy, also expressed the willingness of his Group to partner with the Bank. Among those present at the meeting were officials of the collaborating Organisations, including Vice Presidents of AfDB.<br /><br /><b>By Mathew Dadiya</b><br /><b>Daily Times News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Benue State prides itself as the food basket of the nation. With abundant farm produce in every nook and cranny, its claim is barely in doubt. But, no thanks to the bloody attacks of cattle herders, many indigenes of the state are discouraged, these days, from going to the farm. In this interview with HENRY AKUBUIRO at the Benue State capital, Governor Samuel Ortom calls on the cattle herders to abide by the new state law on ranching as a way of providing lasting peace in the agrarian state or risk jail. Besides, against the backdrop of mounting responsibilities for state governments in the federation, the governor reiterated that more allocations should be channeled to the states than the Federal Government receives at the moment.<br /><br />Some state governors are calling for greater allocations from the Federal Government as against what they get at the moment, in fact, to get more than what the centre is getting. How would a state like Benue react to this?<br /><br />You see, the Federal Government, apart from Abuja that it manages, every other thing in the thirty-six states is managed by the states and, in fact, most times, Federal Government projects are duplication of what the states are doing, especially these constituency projects that you have all over from the National Assembly. You go to a community, and you have three clinics; what are they doing there? It doesn’t make sense. But we [governors] are in touch with the grassroots, with the people; we are here with them. They see us; we interact with them; and we have feedback from them on what they need. But we do not have that money to execute projects that will have direct impact on the people. And sometimes, for the projects sited by the Federal Government, no thorough work is done, no feasibility studies are done, and, especially, when there is no synergy with the state government, it becomes a big problem. So, you see that the burden of governance is more on the states than Federal Government. We will prefer a situation where the Federal Government is deeply involved in coordinating policies and coordinating uniformity and creating the enabling environment with the states so that we can function. When it comes to funding, the states need more than what the Federal Government needs.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yGRtReVWbp4/WezdScEXjCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/UwwktZ-iJv4XeLJhn2lbLBGkT5wQGz6JQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Ortom.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"334\" data-original-width=\"250\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yGRtReVWbp4/WezdScEXjCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/UwwktZ-iJv4XeLJhn2lbLBGkT5wQGz6JQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Ortom.jpg\" width=\"239\" /></a></div><br />You have just called on Nigerian writers to partner with you on advocacy for ranches for cattle herders, how far do you want this to go?<br /><br />I want it to go to all the nooks and crannies of this country because the menace of herdsmen attack is not just on Benue people but it is on other Nigerians as well. We decided to champion the cause of restoring peace, orderliness and security for our own state, and I appreciate the fact that other states are already keying into this programme. That is a global best practice for cattle farming or livestock farming and by the way livestock or cattle farming is a business. You do it to get income to sustain yourself just like we here are farmers and we farm to sustain ourselves, so it should not be done at the detriment of other people. While we are living, we should also respect the rights of other people to live. It should not be at the expense of others, and so I would want this thing to go beyond Benue State, because when it happens to another state, I won’t be a happy man. I know what we suffered between 2012 and 2016. We have estimated that we lost more than N95 billion worth of goods and property, excluding human beings that died. N95 billion! If you go to the rural areas, you see schools, churches, hospitals, houses, farmlands, all that destroyed. In 2013, I lost my rice farm and farm implements. My ancestral home was razed; my entire village was razed; more than 50 people were killed in one day. So, this is a very big challenge.<br /><br />For us to have arrived at sending an executive bill to the House of Assembly, we fasted and prayed, and God gave us that wisdom to have a permanent solution to this problem. Go to America; go to Europe; go to Asia; and even here in African, Kenya and Tanzania are doing it: ranching. I was in Swaziland, a small country, four years ago, and the country’s major earning is beef, but they ranch. So, why can’t we ranch in Nigeria? Where is the land with the upsurge of population? In the 1950s, when people argue that they had cattle routes and grazing areas, the question is:&nbsp; “What was the total population of Nigeria? [It was] less than 40 million people. Today, in 2017, I can approximate it to be over 200 million, because the projection in 2012 was 170 million. So, by today, we should be over 200 million. But what is the land mass now?&nbsp; What was it in 1950? It’s still 923, 000 square kilometres, even less with the ceding of Bakassi to the Cameroon. So, we have a lesser land mass than what used to obtain when we were less in population than now. So, it’s unfortunate that we have kept sealed lips and, honestly, I feel so sad; but I will continue to do what is right, as far as I know, as a person. Even if I die today, I know I have done the right thing. I am championing the cause of ensuring that we have ranching, which is the global best practice, and is the only solution. I have challenged herdsmen; I have challenged any one, including Miyetti Allah, that I am calling for the arrest of the leadership of Miyetti Allah, Kautal Hore, who took us to court for a law that we legitimately passed, and is threatening to invade our state. A law that the Constitution of the Federal Republic of Nigeria permits us to put in place! A law that seeks to protect lives and property! A law that seeks to bring peace to our people! Then, you take us to court.<br /><br />I have said that the security agencies should arrest them for threatening me and my state that they would make the law not to function. I am waiting to see who will trespass. I am waiting to see who will not respect that law in Benue State. I have said it, I am not forcing anyone to live in Benue State. If you want to do open grazing, you can go to any other state that land is available. For me, here we are farmers and we cannot pay salaries as at when due today, so we want to have food on the table for everyone, and we have massively encouraged our people to go into agriculture, and they have done that. There is no single hectare of land available for grazing in Benue State. If you want to stay in Benue State, we are not sending you away –you can stay, but if you have cattle, you must ranch them. If you don’t ranch, the law will catch up with you, and you will be sent to jail. There is no two ways about it. And we are not just talking about cattle –we are talking about livestock –so pigs, goats and all of them are all involved. So, I want as many Nigerians that can support us in advocacy and let people understand, because the misconception is that the law is targeting individuals or Fulani men or certain ethnic groups and so on; it’s not right. The law seeks to ensure peace for every one living in Benue State, including Fulani herdsmen and any other person whatsoever. We want peace. And so, if the herdsmen ranch, the law will protect them from cattle rustlers. There are stiff penalties waiting for cattle rustlers. So, we would appreciate this, whatever you can do within your powers, to reach out to many as are ready to listen to us –please, do –and I believe that God will bless you, because we have suffered enough, and we think that this law is the solution, and I have challenged anyone out there who think that there is a better option of ensuring peace and security for Benue State to bring it on the table. We are ready to call Benue stakeholders to review the whole thing again. But outside that, if they cannot challenge us with a superior policy that will restore peace, they should keep quiet and respect our views.<br /><br />Why is it inevitable to hand over private schools to the owners as you have proposed?<br /><br />We have to make adjustments to meet with the economic realities in which we have found ourselves today as a government. It’s no longer news that we cannot pay salaries as at when due, and we are trying to shelve&nbsp; responsibilities that are making it impossible for us to pay salaries as at when due. If you go out there, private schools and mission schools are doing better than what government is doing, so why should we continue to sponsor them? That is the point. We have discussed with owners of schools, and that was our agreement with them. We feel that we are better off so that government can concentrate more on its schools instead of having half-baked graduates from these schools. We should concentrate on our schools and lay a sound foundation for our children. We want to go back to those days that government schools were respected –that is what motivated us and we are going to do it.<br /><br />Can you achieve it within the time frame you set between now and January 2019?<br /><br />It’s a process that we have to start. Others did not do it, but we want to do it. I think it’s the way out. Government schools will still continue, but if you want to go to a private school, you go there. Even as it is now, people are going to private schools so it doesn’t stop anything. We will continue.<br /><br />How are you able to provide dividends of democracy against the backdrop of economic recession experienced in the country for quite some time?<br /><br />We are prudent, and it has helped us. Here in Benue State, we are very prudent with the little resource we have. One, as a government that has the fear of God, we promised the people even before we came in that we would ensure truthfulness, equity, fairness, justice, transparency, accountability and selflessness. We are not looking at what we can get, but what we can impact on the people. And so that has guided us. Despite the challenges we have, the little that comes in –initially, things were not as bad as they are today, and we were able to channel to those projects. That is why we have impacted today on several communities. When it comes to education, today Benue State University has been paid up to date. When we came, they were on strike for months. We negotiated with them, and because of the attachment we have in promoting education and developing education, we have paid them up to date. At the primary school, we were able to secure N3.8 billion loan to match with UBEC and, today, we have N7.6 billion to promote primary education. Construction of new classroom blocks, provision of instructional materials, provision of desks and all that is going on all over the 276 council wards in Benue State. Some are completed; some are ongoing; some will soon be completed. We are renovating our secondary schools to bring them to a standard that our children will be proud.<br /><br />In the health sector, we have been able to record milestones. The School of Nursing that was shut for five years have been resuscitated, regained accreditation just the same with College of Health Technology, Agasha, and for students of the College of Health Sciences at the Benue State University who were stagnated, medical students that were stagnated for 12 years, a course that could have been completed in six years, for 12&nbsp; years they were there. It was this administration that came with the determination that ‘look we must put this behind us’. We went further and secured all that was needed to get the accreditation. We got it, and, as I talk to you, within two years, we have been able to graduate four sets of medical students who are now medical doctors –152 medical doctors from the Benue State University. On infrastructure, we have constructed several roads linking up communities in the state. We took over from the past administration many uncompleted road projects; we have been able to do some of them with the little resources we have. I can go on and on in empowerment and all that. In all sectors, we have tried. In electricity provision, we have done a lot, they are on record and I hope that the Media Adviser will give you a brochure that we published recently. So far, prudence has guided us and for us we are selfless, it’s not what we get, but it’s what we can do to impact on the people.<br /><br />What is Benue doing to improve on rice production, given that it is a rice producing state, and there is a redirection at the federal level for us to be self-sustaining in rice production?<br /><br />We have done so much since we came in two years ago. In fact, we were almost losing our honour as the food basket of the nation. When we came in we put agriculture top on our priority list and today we have gone back. We have been able to partner with the International Fund for Agriculture Development, IFAD, we paid all the counterpart funding that was needed and massively the impact of IFAD on Benue State agriculture is noticed in almost all the three senatorial districts. We have been able to provide fertilizer on time. We have been able to encourage the people to go back to agriculture, because that is one area that we have comparative advantage and, in the face of difficulties in funding, we feel that food should be on our table and, so, massively, we have encouraged our people. In rice production, we have done so well and we are willing to close the gaps. If you go out to various communities in Benue State, you will see massive rice cultivation and we are looking forward to a bountiful harvest this year. In soya beans production, we are doing very excellent at it. It is just the market that we are looking for. Maize, sesame seed, yam, and cassava are there.<br /><br />In fact, Benue State is blessed. The land is arable, more than 98 percent of it, and with the River Benue and Katsina Ala passing through Benue, we are also taking advantage and encouraging our people that, now, that we have a law guiding that, the Fulani herdsmen will no longer be a threat to agriculture they should go back to the farm and not just restrict themselves to rainy season farming they should go into dry season farming taking advantage of the rivers we have in Benue State and the canals and the streams and, of course, some few dams and so, that is what we are doing. And that is why we have to thank God that we have a law in place now. We will no longer be molested when we go to farm. And I want to appreciate the real Miyetti Allah whom I invited and after explaining to them our predicament that look the land is no longer there, and I had offered to provide security and provide the mobility to take them round Benue State to see things for themselves, to see any area where there is one hectare of land for open grazing. And they appreciated it and embrace this law and advised their members accordingly that, truly, what the governor is saying is true, and it’s a reflection of what the people want. And so, we are very much appreciative to the Almighty God for giving us Benue State, for giving us, this land, and we are ready to not just feeding Nigeria; we are ready to feed Africa.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

The Training Manager, Mr Robert Udeh, told newsmen in Abuja on Wednesday that the training would aid efforts to compute all transactions of the project effectively. Udeh, who is also the System Analyst of Tokuns International Limited, said: “We are software developers; the training is on financial management system, using the flexible account software.<br /><br />“The FADAMA III project workers would be trained for effective delivery of the project “We are here to train them on the use of the software because they have to produce regular reports on the funds they received from World Bank. “They also have to give an account of how the money they received has been spent, in line with the goals of the project. “We are basically interested in the accounting part of the FADAMA programme.<br /><br />“We are to train the officers on how to use the software to produce reliable reports on transactions and on how to generate reports for submission to the World Bank,’’ he said.

    "content": "Rich, Natural Cocoa in West Africa Nigeria, a one time leading cocoa exporter in Africa is out in the cold as Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire move to address unfavorable cocoa pricing regime in the international market. To reduce the vulnerability of both nations to the volatility of the markets, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire have joined forces to address the unfavorable global cocoa pricing regime, President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo has confirmed.<br /><br />Manifest injustice Akufo-Addo described as “manifest injustice” the situation where, for the 2015 Crop Season, both countries earned only 5.75 million dollars for their entire output which accounted for 65 percent of the world’s cocoa production – at a time when the global market was worth some 100 billion dollars.<br /><br />“This means that our farmers, through whose toil and sweat the cocoa industry was founded, earned 5.75 per cent of the global value chain of the industry. This is manifest injustice. It cannot and should not continue. “We will not continue to be victims or pawns of the global cocoa industry that is dependent on the work of our farmers,” he said in Accra at a state dinner he hosted in honour of Ivorian President, Alassane Ouattara at the Accra International Conference Centre.<br /><br />The highlight of the evening’s event was the conferment of the highest state award of Companion of the Star of Ghana, Honorary Division, on President Ouattara in recognition of his “exceptional leadership and incomparable commitment towards deepening the close friendship and cooperation between Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ2jDNqqoaU/WfwwHEbiZwI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/SLLQnTjkM8s6M5lcshLUPLG1awAVaQ-YACLcBGAs/s1600/Rich%2BNatural%2BCocoa%2Bin%2BWest%2BAfrica.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"394\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"210\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-KQ2jDNqqoaU/WfwwHEbiZwI/AAAAAAAAAoQ/SLLQnTjkM8s6M5lcshLUPLG1awAVaQ-YACLcBGAs/s320/Rich%2BNatural%2BCocoa%2Bin%2BWest%2BAfrica.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />President Akufo-Addo said he and his Ivorian counterpart had decided to work to provide the necessary leadership for technical and political cooperation that would effectively address the international cocoa price decline in the short-to-medium term.<br /><br />He said they both were fashioning “far reaching policies” towards achieving a shared vision of an industrialised and prosperous cocoa economy, saying; “This would reduce our vulnerability to the volatility of the market and help deliver prosperity to our farmers and people.” President Akufo-Addo reiterated the high priority Ghana placed on her relationship with Cote d’Ivoire, emphasising that; “If we work together and harmonise our policies, we can protect our farmers and guarantee a better life for them. “We are amongst the biggest economies in<br /><br />West Africa; we are bonded by common history, by common ethnic ties, by common culture and by common geography. These ties impose on us the necessity to work together and to live as good neighbours with each one being the others keeper,” he said. Whilst commending the Ivorian leader for his show of statesmanship in the verdict of the delimitation of the maritime boundaries of both countries, President Akufo-Addo noted that though both countries had accepted the judgment, what was of paramount importance was the peaceful exploitation of the maritime resources for their benefits.<br /><br />He called for stronger collaboration between Ghana and the Ivory Coast to ensure the full engagement of their other sister countries in the process of West African integration to make the bloc a strong regional economic player. President Ouattara, in his response, expressed gratitude to the Government and people of Ghana for the outstanding show of hospitality extended to him and his delegation.<br /><br />“It is a testimony of the traditional and legendary hospitality of the Ghanaian people,” he said. Furthermore, Ouattara said his visit to Ghana exemplified the strong bonds between both countries and their shared determination to inject a new momentum into the co-operation between Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana.<br /><br />Stressing the need to accelerate actions to intensify and strengthen the new type of partnership that both countries strived to establish for their people, President Ouattara said the productive and constructive interactions he had had with President Akufo-Addo, since assuming the reins of governance, had allowed him to appreciate the seriousness his Ghanaian counterpart attached to the bilateral relations between both nations. He gave the assurance of his firm commitment and total willingness to continue to work to strengthen the privileged relations between both countries and their peoples.<br /><br /><b>By Gbubemi God’s Covenant Snr</b><br /><b>Daily Times News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigeria’s First Roundnut Spread, Nutzy Peanut Butter, Lands on Store Shelves",
    "content": "<br />The nation’s agric value chain development appears to be gaining more acceptance with the entry of Nigeria’s first ever locally-produced groundnut spread – Nutzy peanut butter – which the makers say offers more even value than imported brands.<br /><br />The brand, a product of the food division of VIK Industries Limited, a diversified conglomerate that has been in operation in Nigeria for over 50 years, has opened new vista of opportunities for groundnut farmers in terms of guaranteed uptake of products and adds a fresh angle to culinary choices of Nigerians.<br /><br />Managing Director, VIK Industries, Mr. Ajay Ramnanai, said that apart from the usual bread spread, Nuttzy peanut butter can be applied in different ways including preparation of local soups, sauces and dips.<br /><br />He said the idea of venturing into local production of groundnut spread came about from his realisation that foreign peanut butter brands had dominated the store shelves over the years which made a solid business case for local production given that groundnut is widely produced and consumed across many parts of the country.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3d3DxWjI12k/Wfwu2AxZ22I/AAAAAAAAAoE/Zv2KlCI0OfUnuGB0ZOKlwzQSnVzFWMSngCLcBGAs/s1600/Ground%2BNut%2B%2526%2Bpeanut%2Bbutter.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"183\" data-original-width=\"275\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-3d3DxWjI12k/Wfwu2AxZ22I/AAAAAAAAAoE/Zv2KlCI0OfUnuGB0ZOKlwzQSnVzFWMSngCLcBGAs/s1600/Ground%2BNut%2B%2526%2Bpeanut%2Bbutter.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Ramnani said extensive research had resulted in a high quality product that offers much more value in terms of pricing and packaging, yet had the unique taste that only Nigerian groundnut varieties, widely acknowledged as among the best in the world, could offer.<br /><br />According to him, “The major advantage is local groundnut taste. I think the groundnuts available in Nigeria are of really good quality. They are exportable standard and Nigerian groundnuts don’t taste like that anywhere in the world. It has a distinct flavour. So I think the fact that we have that flavour in our peanut butter is what really differentiates us. In terms of quality, we have a fully automated food factory so there is nothing compromising. In terms of the price, I’d say we’re less than half the price of all imported brands.”<br /><br />He also noted that peanut butter offer a healthier alternative to more common spreads such as margarine and mayonnaise, as it contains unsaturated fatty acids with low cholesterol, high protein and fibre content, which makes it suitable and wholesome part of the diet for all age groups especially children as well as people with special needs such as diabetics and those seeking to lose weight.<br /><br />Ramnani said the company was looking forward to introducing other varieties apart from the “creamy” and “crunchy” variants currently in the market and has been well received going by results from an ongoing sampling and market activation campaign being implemented in different open markets and retail stores in major cities across Nigeria.<br /><br />Speaking on the challenges facing the manufacturing sector, Ramnani, advocated more support for the critical sector through a broad incentives regime, stressing that this was the key to job creation efforts.<br /><br />He emphasised the need for increased value addition to Nigerian agricultural products, which he said would deliver the twin benefits of conserving foreign exchange outflow while boosting much needed inflows.<br /><br />This effort, he noted, requires private sector input and investments to make it work. “I’d say they should definitely go for it. I’d say that they should help us expand our agricultural industry. The government is pushing and we need to do our own bit to help, there’s only so much the government can do but at the end of the day, there has to be a market for the produce.”<br /><br /><b>By: Tonia ‘Diyan</b><br /><b>Tha Nation Newss</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

So, no panic in the area, the situation in the area is calm.’’<br /><br />The Benue State Command Police Public Relations officer, ASP Moses Yamu, confirmed the attack. He said the command received a report on November 2 that there was an attack on Azege village in Logo where suspected herdsmen passed through in the early hours of the day.<br /><br />“The DPO and mobile policemen stationed at Ayilamo quickly moved in and discovered that one Ortser Kwaghdoo was killed while Hingir Akaa sustained injuries,” he said.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the leadership of the Universal Reformed Christian Church Worldwide has condemned the reaction of the Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association to the Anti-Open Grazing Law recently signed into law by the Benue State Government.<br /><br />The group, in a statement on Thursday by its President, Rev. Dr Ayohol Ate, called on the Federal Government to prevail on cattle breeders not to disregard the law.<br /><br />The statement read, “As leaders of the church and of the people, we unequivocally condemn the continuous intimidation and violent acts against our people and the calculated attempts to humiliate our political leaders. We also condemn in the strongest terms the call to anarchy by the leadership of Miyetti Allah Cattle Breeders Association.<br /><br />“We unanimously call on the President, Muhammadu Buhari and the leadership of the National Assembly, as a matter of urgency, to caution the leadership of Miyetti Allah. When the law is spurned, the law of the jungle becomes the sad alternative.

    "content": "<br />Cattle dealers in Benue say their business is on the verge of collapse because of the anti-open grazing law, which comes into effect on Wednesday.<br /><br />Some officials of the Cattle Dealers Association of Nigeria made the claim, while speaking with News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) in Makurdi on Wednesday.<br /><br />They said that the law failed to differentiate between herdsmen and cattle dealers, adding that action had consequently affected the business of cattle dealers.<br /><br />Alhaji Mustapha Aliyu, the chief of the main cattle market in Makurdi, said that cattle dealers in the market had lost over 10 cattle, excluding the calves.<br /><br />“The cattle have no water to drink, no food for them. The situation is particularly harrowing for the pregnant ones that are about to deliver. Most of the dead ones are the pregnant cows who couldn’t cope with the situation,’’ he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6LrFyM6sxaE/WfrZ7bDFzRI/AAAAAAAAAnQ/3EWLjZWk2kgMO4sCdkroLKWzY8F736XfACLcBGAs/s1600/Cattle%2BBreeders.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-6LrFyM6sxaE/WfrZ7bDFzRI/AAAAAAAAAnQ/3EWLjZWk2kgMO4sCdkroLKWzY8F736XfACLcBGAs/s320/Cattle%2BBreeders.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said that the cattle were going through tough times, adding that if nothing was done to salvage the situation on time, the cattle would all perish.<br /><br />Aliyu alleged that a member of his association was arrested in the Gbajimba neighbourhood for flouting the law, adding that he was later released after paying some fine.<br /><br />He said that 10 other cattle locations in the state were sealed by members of vigilante groups and moaned that hoodlums had taken undue advantage of the law to extort money from herdsmen and cattle dealers.<br /><br />He noted that the vast lands allocated to the cattle dealers during the administration of ex-Gov. George Akume were encroached upon, adding that the lands had shrunk from 113 hectares to only 12 hectares.<br /><br />Another official, Suleiman Ahmad, said that top government officials had brought their cattle to the market for rearing at one time or the other.<br /><br />He said that some of the officials were even members of the Gov. Samuel Ortom’s administration.<br /><br />Ahmad wondered why the government failed to consider the interests of cattle dealers when the law was being conceived, saying that cattle dealers were not herdsmen but businessmen who had contributed a lot to the growth of the state’s economy.<br /><br />He said that the market had a population of about 5,000 cattle, with over 200 cattle owners.<br /><br />Ahmad said that the law would destroy all the cattle and make the cattle owners to lose their livelihood.<br /><br />He recalled that the cattle market was established by the Federal Government during the tenure of the Akume-administration between 1999 and 2007.<br /><br />Another member of the association, Yusuf Mohammed, said that the cost of keeping cattle in a ranch might be too excessive for those involved in the cattle trade.<br /><br />He said that the government’s decision to include trade cattle in the open range cattle grazing prohibition law was aimed at destroying the business of cattle dealers.<br /><br />However, Mr George Ibese, the Commandant of the Vigilante Group in Benue, denied the claims that some cattle markets were closed, saying that the vigilantes only went to the markets to explain the law to the dealers.<br /><br />He also denied the allegation that a cattle dealer was arrested and ordered to pay a fine.<br /><br />He, however, conceded that three herdsmen from Shendam, who were passing through the state, were arrested by the vigilantes and handed over the police.<br /><br />Ibese said that the herdsmen were later escorted out of Gbajimba to Daudu on the outskirts of the state, prior to their return to their base in Shendam.<br /><br />When contacted, retired Col. Edwin Jando, the Chairman of Benue Anti Grazing Committee, said that he was not aware of any infringement of the law.

Egwuonwu who spoke recently on the menace of rice smuggling warned that the trend if not checked, would ruin many of the local rice industries who may be forced to close shop and lay off their workers.<br /><br />He noted that it was painful and unimaginable that men of Customs and Excise could not come out with any water-tight measure to checkmate the rampaging smugglers. The rice miller was of the opinion that the Comptroller of Customs should resign if he could no longer contain the ugly trend of rising smuggling activities.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAmw/vQdHDB_oGSkI69SLTybo-URYVVE2hg1HQCLcBGAs/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"182\" data-original-width=\"278\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1RIRsqje30k/WfrI5rptFYI/AAAAAAAAAmw/vQdHDB_oGSkI69SLTybo-URYVVE2hg1HQCLcBGAs/s1600/local-rice.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“Porous border is really affecting local rice producers negatively. That is the major problem we are facing now.&nbsp; Smuggling has been the bane of our upward movement in this sector. Our production has been stalled and all the rice millers are operating in an unhealthy environment. Let the Customs close the borders and man them very well so that we can survive,” Chief Egwuonwu said. He noted that apart from being economic sabotage, brands of rice brought into the country are of low quality, comparatively and not quite safe for human consumption.<br /><br />“Though prices are beginning to go down because of the efforts of the Federal Government and Anambra state government under Governor Willie Obiano who is helping farmers including rice millers, but this needs to be sustained and complemented with closure of borders. This will make Nigeria a net rice exporter in the next three years begin to export rice to other countries,” he submitted.<br /><br /><b>By: David Onwuchekwa,</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Nigerian Exported Yam was Not Rejected in the U.K —NAQS Boss",
    "content": "<br />Following some reports that the United Kingdom rejected yam tubers exported from Nigeria, COLLINS NNABUIFE spoke with the Coordinating Director of Nigeria Agriculture Quarantine Service, Dr Vincent Isegbe, who explained what happened and other developments in the agricultural sector<br /><br />Recently, there was a report quoting the Minister of Agriculture that the tubers of yam exported to U.K were rejected, what actually happened?<br /><br />The tubers of yams were not rejected, the Minister didn’t say the yam was rejected, all he said was that the Nigerian Agriculture Quarantine Service should investigate what was shown on television. Some tubers of yams were shown in a warehouse and were tagged as bad. The story was that a Nigerian exporting yam to the United Kingdom, the video shown that at that point, the yam had gotten bad, the man clearly mentioned that when he put the yam in the container, it took about a week before it was put into the ship, and the shipping line did not carry the consignment to the UK until after 3 months, so naturally, yam being what it is could not survive such carriage and it ended up being bad, so it is just a logistic issue with the person that shipped the yam for him.<br /><br />Is there anything government is doing to address this logistic issue so that it doesn’t affect export of agricultural produce?<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1w3l8txNUA8/WfiKNCTDp4I/AAAAAAAAAlo/NI1JRcDJhtgx9DO2DgOKfK1EsrGXOk2LQCLcBGAs/s1600/ISEGBE.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1w3l8txNUA8/WfiKNCTDp4I/AAAAAAAAAlo/NI1JRcDJhtgx9DO2DgOKfK1EsrGXOk2LQCLcBGAs/s320/ISEGBE.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>That one is not directly a quarantine issue but it is of concern to us that having certified the yam, it was rejected, for every export, if it does not get to its destination, it is not good for us, we consider it as bad business, but we ensure that if issues like that are brought to our notice we can intervene to find out what is happening. It is not our mandate to engage shipping lines with the exporter, but we can help to ensure that the conditions for the shipping lines are there for whoever is shipping his consignment.<br /><br /><b>What are the procedures for exporting yam?</b><br /><br />We want to advise people who are going into business, every business is not all comers affairs, you need to find answers to some questions or else if you buy the commodity first before looking for market, you will run into problems.<br /><br />If somebody wants to export, the first port of call is the market before thinking of getting the yam to supply to the market, if you have the market, then you know where the commodities are going to, so you approach the NAQS and tell them the location the yam is going because in the phyto-Sanitary certificate for any agricultural produce, the exporter with the destination will have to be quoted in the certificate, then we will now tell you how to get the correct commodity to export.<br /><br />For yam, we do not advise you to go to the open market to buy yam to export, it is not advisable, you need Quarantine guidance, once you come to Quarantine we sit down with you, we interview you and guide you properly and give you the guideline so that you can go home with it.<br /><br />Why we say potential exporter shouldn’t buy from the open market is because you don’t know how long the yam had stayed with the farmer before he sold it to the middleman who eventually brought it to the market and how long it has stayed in the store and don’t forget the stores we have here most of them are not concrete, and so there is a likelihood of seepage and once there is&nbsp; seepage from the ground or the wall if they are wet, moulds can easily grow and once those moulds grow on yam it can contaminate other yam tubers, so we want to avoid that.<br /><br />So we want to ensure that the yam tubers&nbsp; that are exported go directly from the farmer who is producing it with minimal delay to Quarantine inspection, to the container straight to shipment, all in all, these process should not take more than two weeks so that the commodity can get to that place clean and safe.<br /><br />So the criteria involve Quarantine from the word go, we volunteer to even help you select the yam, after the selection, we do the inspection, after the inspection, we give you the phyto-Sanitary certificate, once you get the certificate you will arrange for the container that will carry the yam, we will also inspect the container because it is our responsibility to ensure that the container is refrigerated which can maintain a temperature of about 14 degrees to about 20 degrees so that the yam can get there safe, when it gets to the other side, the Quarantine authority of the importing country will receive it look at the phyto-Sanitary certificate, see that everything is in order, then they allow it to pass.<br /><br />We have more than 65 Quarantine stations in the whole country, so farmers will have access, we have five zones; We have the North Western zone in Kano, the North Eastern zone in Maiduguri, North Central in Markudi, South West in Lagos and South East in Port-Harcourt and in between those zones, we have offices scattered round those zones, so any farmer who wants to export should approach Quarantine.<br /><br /><b>What is the development on the issue between FAAN and NAQS?</b><br /><br />The issue of FAAN was as a result of this executive order 001 and they are trying to realign the number of people on the inspection desk to ensure that there is quick clearance of goods and commodities, it is a beautiful idea, that the relevant authorities should be the ones there to do what they are supposed to do, but Nigeria is desirous to export commodities and the agency of government responsible for certifying, inspecting, preventing disease from coming in and going out is Quarantine Service and now the implementing agencies like FAAN and others are saying that Quarantine should not be where it is supposed to be, so we wonder who is going to do what Quarantine is suppose to do, no other other agency can issue phyto-Sanitary certificate apart from Quarantine.<br /><br />The essence of executive order 001 is to ease business, and in doing that too you should consider your national interest, the national interest for Nigeria now is to encourage non oil export so that we can supplement the dwindling resources from oil, so we are still talking with FAAN to let them see reasons why we should be there to do in the interest of government.<br /><br /><b>Apart from yam, are you supporting exportation of other agricultural produce?</b><br /><br />We are encouraging emerging products or commodities, a lot of things that we have in this country that are in dire need, take sugar cane for example it is good business, onion, garlic, ginger, are good businesses, hibiscus flower ( used for zobo) is good business in Mexico, Spain and other countries, because it is organic they use it to colour wine and pharmaceutical companies because it is organic instead of using artificial colours, they use our Zobo, and our Zobo is the best grade in the world it can titrate up to four times other African countries cannot achieve that, so we are in a prime position to export hibiscus, about 800 containers have left, we have about a thousand more containers that<br /><br />are about going, Nigerians are doing these things quietly, so we are still encouraging more people to come up.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Agriculture and the Future of Africa",
    "content": "<br />Africa is continent of 55 countries and thousands of nationalities with incredible human and cultural diversity. Anthropologists have long associated the prevalence of human and cultural diversity with biological, ecological, ecosystem and agricultural biodiversity. Africa is an outstanding evidence of that concordance.&nbsp; In addition to its wealth of incredible diversity, Africa is the youngest and fastest growing continent. In 2050, a quarter of the world’s people would be resident in Africa (2.5 billion). Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country, would rank the world’s third. Over 70 per cent of Africans would be under 30 years of age! How can the continent harness this incredible potential which could readily flip into unprecedented tragedy if not well-managed? That is the big question for the future of Africa. That future is at the intersection of strength and a ticking time bomb.<br /><br />In a way, Africa’s future lies on the continent’s ability to capitalise on its strengths, to exploit its late-comer advantage in the development dynamic. A few of those strengths and their intersections include the continent’s population and youth power; its traditional knowledge and the latter’s intersection with technologies, all of which have ramifications for agriculture as a crucial sector for the continent’s political and economic stability.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HnY1TBOPKX0/WdcyroMCzwI/AAAAAAAAAQU/AzfYlM1zzNoDMlBpt4ZtlJpo_jUem42nQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmer2.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"413\" data-original-width=\"734\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-HnY1TBOPKX0/WdcyroMCzwI/AAAAAAAAAQU/AzfYlM1zzNoDMlBpt4ZtlJpo_jUem42nQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Farmer2.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>As a starting point, Africa must be able to feed itself. In doing so, it must creatively engage its youth and leverage the continent’s value-added in the global market place by interfacing information communication technologies with agro production and marketing. The need to fill the gap between youth power and the continent’s ability to feed itself needs no emphasis. Most political ruptures in history from the historical bred riots to fairly recent Arab Spring have been linked to the frustrations of a hungry population which is inevitably an angry population.<br /><br />But development experts construct Africa, as they do of world’s indigenous peoples, as in a desperate need for “capacity building and capacity development” in virtually all areas including agriculture. They are wont to recommend orthodox solutions. Hardly any regard is given to what the rest could learn from Africa. For example, they prescribe hi-tech/industrial agriculture as the solution to Africa’s food insecurity. Now, the entire country, including Nigeria is in a race to the bottom over the introduction of genetically modified organism as the prime gift of agro-biotechnology to be uncritically embraced. But “experts” are silent on the cost of that approach or the overall industrial agriculture option on the continent.<br /><br />In a counterintuitive way, these uncritical advocates of capacity building and capacity development are themselves in need of inward capacity development to understand Africa’s realities. Hi-tech agricultural has troubling legacies ill-suited for replication in Africa.&nbsp; Consider this: Since 1990s, we have lost 75 per cent of plant genetic resource diversity for food and agriculture. Today, 24 billion tonnes of healthy soil and 15 million trees are lost yearly; one third of the world’s agricultural land is degraded. The future of industrial agriculture beyond 60 years is bleak! Only 3-5 mega transnational agro-chemical corporations have monopoly over key economic crops; we rely on three – rice, maize and wheat – (out of an estimated 30,000) of those for 75 per cent of our calorie intake. For these mega agro transnational corporations, African is another market frontier for their investments.<br /><br />Africa’s case is different: At 874 million hectares, Africa has 60 per cent world’s fertile land. Of 600 million Africans engaged in farming, 80 per cent are women. They are smallholder farmers. They are, by default, organic farmers relying mainly on TK and agrobiodiversity. The costs of wholesale adoption of industrial agriculture include massive social disruption and displacement of rural populations, deforestation, and replacement of agrobiodiversity with monoculture. Those are already evident from developments across the continent from Cote d’Ivoire to Cameroon; Liberia to Ethiopia, for example. Other costs include degradation of soil quality, another race to the bottom in the form of foreign direct investment desperation in agriculture which has resulted in unconscionable massive agricultural land grab across the continent. Gradually in agriculture, we are at the risk of repeating what has happened in the pharmaceutical sector. There, R&amp;D priorities are set by the Big Pharma, with huge investments in medicines for the rich and diseases of the affluent as opposed to the needs of the poor and vulnerable. With Africa’s agriculture in the hands of agro-TNCs, R&amp;D agenda in agriculture will be far removed from Africa’s priorities and needs in agro-biodiversity and the sustainability of traditional agricultural knowledge and practices. That is not a viable pathway for the continent.<br /><br />Africa’s factor endowment in TK-driven agriculture sustains ‘the culture in agriculture’ as Africa’s way of life. The communal and cultural components of agriculture in Africa are the reason African agriculture resists being reduced to mere production line of industrial monoculture. Africa can lead the search for how best to integrate its agricultural traditions into a sustainable and winning business model. That would include selective and dynamic adaptation of technologies such as those relating to climate change adaptation and mitigation, not to mention irrigation (only four per cent of Africa’s agriculture benefits from irrigation technology) and the use of new ICTs for global market optimisation of Africa’s niche and value-added in crop diversity and organic production. Not only would ICT bridge the gap between farmers and sophisticated brokers in the global value chain, it would open untapped legitimate branding through trademarking options, geographical indications and other custom market options.&nbsp; Although it may feel like the genie is out of the bottle, African may yet resist being screwed by the global supply/value chain. Through internal self-sustaining investments in its areas of factor endowment, it may still avoid developmental havocs of advanced economies by re-thinking the prospects of agriculture for the continent’s future in a constructive manner in relation to the self-serving and conventional prescriptions of western development experts.<br /><br />Oguamanam is Full Professor, Faculty of Law, University of Ottawa, Co-Founder Open African Innovation Research.

    "content": "<br />A former Military Head of State, Abdulsalami Abubakar, says Nigeria loses not less than $13.7bn annually as a result of farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts in Benue, Kaduna, Nasarawa and Plateau states.<br /><br />The News Agency of Nigeria reported that Abubakar said this at a forum organised by the Search for Common Ground, Nigeria, in collaboration with the Abdulsalami Abubakar Institute for Peace and Sustainable Development.<br /><br />The forum, with the theme, “Amplifying the Expertise of African Peace-building Practitioners and Scholars, was organised for farmers and herdsmen at Maizube Farm in the Bosso Local Government Area of Niger State on Monday.<br /><br />Abubakar said 62,000 people were displaced in Kaduna, Benue and Plateau states between January, 2015 and February&nbsp; 2017, in farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts.<br /><br />He said 2,500 people died nationwide in farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rnna7Lq1fCI/Weho4d2R36I/AAAAAAAAAfY/DXXRFNr2OwUoHx8eZ-9gQl4EZgvltf9vwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Herdsmen.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"170\" data-original-width=\"227\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Rnna7Lq1fCI/Weho4d2R36I/AAAAAAAAAfY/DXXRFNr2OwUoHx8eZ-9gQl4EZgvltf9vwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Herdsmen.jpg\" /></a></div>He commended the Search for Common Ground for initiating the forum with a view to building synergy between the academia and practitioners, as well as to generate evidence for policy-making on farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts in Nigeria.<br /><br />Abubakar said the initiative would further reduce farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts in Nigeria through a holistic interrogation of issues critical to resolving the conflicts in Nigeria and Africa.<br /><br />He added that the initiative would enhance and boost relationships that had existed between the two interdependent groups and reduce the impacts of the conflicts on the affected communities.<br /><br />He said, “Farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts have become a threat to peace, security and development of our nation.<br /><br />“This meeting is coming at a critical time when farmers and herders’ conflicts have become an issue of global concern.”<br /><br />Abubakar said the worry had heightened “with the recent crises in Plateau, Benue and other states that led to loss of lives, properties, displacement of persons and families, and untold hardships to communities and individuals affected.<br /><br />“These deadly conflicts are expanding gradually to other states, and the current situation is threatening the fragile peace and security of the nation.”<br /><br />Abubakar called on the forum and other relevant stakeholders to come up with suggestions, including the roles of governments, the civil society, the media, traditional rulers, communities and professionals, in addressing the conflicts.<br /><br />He advised stakeholders to strengthen the capacities of organisations working with farmers and herdsmen, women, communities and youths in addressing their needs.<br /><br />Conflict Analyst, Search for Common Ground, Mrs. Bukola Ademola, attributed farmers and herdsmen’s conflicts in Nigeria to unequal access to land and resources between farmers and herdsmen.<br /><br />She said livelihood was a factor that directly pitted farmers and herdsmen against each other in competition for resources to sustain crops and animals.<br /><br />According to her, addressing this protracted and often violent conflict requires a new way of doing things and building synergy between peace-building practitioners and researchers.<br /><br />Meanwhile, a&nbsp; religious organisation in Tiv land, known as Universal Reformed&nbsp; Christian Church, popularly known as NKST, on Monday called on the Federal&nbsp; Government to restrict&nbsp; Fulani herdsmen to the far northern part of Nigeria.<br /><br />The president of the church, Dr. Ayohol Ate, at a press briefing held at the Benue State Secretariat of Nigeria Union of Journalists, Makurdi, hinged the call on what they described as ‘the resistance of the herders to the state anti-open grazing law expected to take effect this Wednesday, November 1, 2017.<br /><br />The president, who was represented by Rev. Dr. Kurugh Antyer, said, “The Fulani have attacked the Tiv, Agatu and the Jukuns, killing, wounding, and maiming hundreds of people on their ancestral land and have turned their crops into pasture for their animals and have gone a step further by occupying the deserted homes.<br /><br />“The government should note that the Benue valley land is already insufficient for indigenous farmers, let alone sharing it with the Fulanis. There is, therefore, no reason to think of creating grazing reserves on a land that is already insufficient for its original inhabitants. The Fulanis should be restricted to their states in the far north of Nigeria.”<br /><br /><b>By: John Charles</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

It will also lift nearly 250 million Africans out of poverty by 2025.<br /><br />A statement from the bank said 25 African countries have written letters, confirming their interest and readiness to participate in TAAT, and help transform their agriculture.<br /><br />TAAT, according to the bank, will support its Feed Africa Strategy for the continent to eliminate the current massive importation of food and transform its economies by targeting agriculture as a major source of economic diversification and wealth, as well as a powerful engine for job creation.<br /><br />The commodities value chains to benefit from this initiative are rice, cassava, pearl millet, sorghum, groundnut, cowpea, livestock, maize, soya bean, yam, cocoa, coffee, cashew, palm oil, horticulture, beans, wheat and fish.<br /><br />AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina, at a TAAT side event in Des Moines, Iowa, United States, said: “TAAT was born out of this major consultation and brings together global players in agriculture, the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, the World Bank, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, World Food Programme, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, Rockefeller Foundation and national and regional agricultural research systems.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5ebw1SQ1yYg/WfMOCXXX1zI/AAAAAAAAAlE/JBel3qA9OdQrgUk6pYARAvQ2I2WTriJSgCLcBGAs/s1600/AfDB%2BExecutive.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"250\" data-original-width=\"500\" height=\"160\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-5ebw1SQ1yYg/WfMOCXXX1zI/AAAAAAAAAlE/JBel3qA9OdQrgUk6pYARAvQ2I2WTriJSgCLcBGAs/s320/AfDB%2BExecutive.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“It’s the biggest consolidation of efforts to accelerate agriculture technology uptake in Africa. Technology will address the variability and the new pests and diseases that will surely arise with climate change,” he said.<br /><br />Adesina explained that TAAT would help break down decades of national boundary-focused seed release systems. Seed companies will have regional business investments, not just national ones, he said. “That will be revolutionary and will open up regional seed industries and markets.”<br /><br />TAAT, he explained, is to be implemented through a collectively agreed central delivery platform, coordinated by the International Institute for Tropical Agriculture, with national, regional and international agricultural research centres.<br /><br />“TAAT is a transformative and landmark partnership effort. The African Development Bank, World Bank, AGRA, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Rockefeller Foundation intend to mobilize US $1 billion to help scale up technologies across Africa.”<br /><br />The Director, External Communications, African Region, World Bank Group, Haleh Bridi, described TAAT as a regional technology delivery infrastructure for agriculture, linking countries across agro-ecological zones.<br /><br />Bridi stressed that Africa can learn from Asia, which had made “amazing strides” in its agricultural revolution. “This is why we are involved in the TAAT programme,” she said to resounding applause.<br /><br />The Director for Agricultural Development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Nick Austin, said, “Technology obviously evolves the journey to prosperity, the way economies transform and the way small-holder farmers engage.<br /><br />“Locally, there are varieties. Locally, there are new technologies and solutions to small-holder farmers. We are in the position to play a key role in bringing the best technologies available and supporting new ways in delivering this to farmers. We are delighted and excited to be part of this initiative.”<br /><br />The President of Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), Agnes Kalibata, stressed that African governments should drive technological development in agriculture.<br /><br />“What TAAT is going to have to do is work with the governments. We have lots of institutions that are ready for these technologies. We should work with governments to ensure that the technologies are not just ready to work, but become available to their country people. I think that ensuring that the farmers get all the technologies they need is going to be very important,” she said.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Nigeria has saved over N216 billion from the importation of rice alone from Thailand and other countries since the nation’s domestic mass production flooded the markets under the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme (ABP).<br /><br />Prince Niyi Akenzua, the Executive Director, Risk Management and Finance, Bank of Agriculture (BOA) disclosed on Thursday in Ibadan when he visited Gov. Abiola Ajimobi of Oyo State.<br /><br />The News Agency of Nigeria(NAN) reports that Akenzua had led some other officials of the bank on the visit to the state.<br /><br />He said that the figure represented a fraction of a staggering $22 billion (N7.92trillion) spent on importation of foods into the country annually prior to the advent of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.<br /><br />Akenzua said it was worthy of commendation that the country had committed itself to diversifying from oil economy, with emphasis on revitalisation of agriculture.<br /><br />He said he had embarked on advocacy visit around the country to enlist the support and involvement of state governments in ABP, which freed the country from reliance on importation of rice.<br /><br />“We enjoin Oyo State to participate in the ABP as we have remodelled the programme to expand the scope of beneficiaries.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mtOZJDZsAus/WfMMBaS9iNI/AAAAAAAAAk4/m9gj-EqHYnglBgjgB1WvjQU2N4M1cjnJwCLcBGAs/s1600/Rice%2BProduction.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"650\" height=\"172\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-mtOZJDZsAus/WfMMBaS9iNI/AAAAAAAAAk4/m9gj-EqHYnglBgjgB1WvjQU2N4M1cjnJwCLcBGAs/s320/Rice%2BProduction.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“The pilot scheme was so successful that $600m was saved from rice importation due to massive rice production in the country.<br /><br />“One or two rice millers in Thailand have closed down because Nigeria, which has always been their major importer, has stopped importing their rice.<br /><br />“We used to spend $22 billion importing food into Nigeria and with our consciousness that every square meter in the country is arable land.<br /><br />“We felt that it was not sustainable. Of course, the crash in crude oil price has forced us back to agriculture,’’ he said.<br /><br />Akenzua said that the state could choose a particular crop to produce under the programme, with a promise to co-fund or fund the production of such crop.<br /><br />Ajimobi in his remarks commended the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh for the positive changes he had brought into the agriculture sector since he assumed duties at the ministry.<br /><br />The governor stated that the fundamental problem besetting the country was attitudinal, stressing that the country was not bereft of knowledge, policies and programmes capable of enhancing its economy.<br /><br />Ajimobi said that the state was supposed to be the food basket of the nation if past leaders had seen agriculture as a major solution to unemployment, hunger and economic driver.<br /><br />According to him, the state is in good stead to be a major agric hub, judging by the concentration of reputable research institutions in the state and its vast arable land.<br /><br />“The state is also strategically located between Lagos, the commercial nerve centre of the country and the North among other comparative advantages.”<br /><br />He advised the new management of BOA to do all that is humanly possible to sustain the momentum in its renewed drive to revitalise the agriculture sector.<br /><br />“You need to change the attitude of our people so they will know that there is money in agriculture.<br /><br />“We are in this sorry state today because of bureaucracy and lack of sustenance of past agric policies. What has happened to Operation Feed the Nation?<br /><br />“Don’t just talk the talk, walk the talk. In the past, some people will just give loans to themselves, which they knew they would not recover and this had crippled the bank.”<br /><br />The governor stated that the state was ready to take advantage of all opportunities available in agriculture to promote the standard of living of its people.<br /><br />The governor promised to lead by example by also venturing into commercial agriculture, urging the BOA team to advise him on how he could go about obtaining a loan for the purpose<br /><br /><b>Source: The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

We call for more support from the development banks to build agriculture,” she stated.<br /><br />The President, Nigerian-Brazilian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr. Emmanuel Ibru, who discussed the theme from a private sector perspective, maintained that the control of land by state and local governments made land unavailable for people who wanted to invest in the agricultural sector while at the same time acting as a disincentive to Foreign Direct Investment.<br /><br />He pointed out that although the FDI had gradually returned to the country following the relative stability in the&nbsp; oreign exchange market,&nbsp; the investment was not really going to the agricultural sector because of the bottlenecks associated with acquiring land.<br /><br />Ibru said the process of accessing land was quite lengthy and frustrating while taking control was a problem.<br /><br />He said the state governors were empowered by the act to withdraw Certificates of Occupancy that were dully issued without giving any tangible reason.<br /><br />“I am handling a case now where a foreign firm paid for 17,000 hectares of land for oil palm plantation to the state government and for over four years now, they have been unable to make use of the land,” he said.<br /><br />He urged government to consider amending the Land Use Act to make land more accessible to investors who would want to invest in the agricultural sector and frowned on cases of arbitrary charges imposed on land by the state governors.<br /><br />He said the policies of the government towards encouraging diversification into agriculture looked good on paper but their implementation was flawed.<br /><br />Ibru pointed out that the capital outlay on agriculture was huge and there was a need for banks to support practitioners with low interest loan.<br /><br />“The current nine per cent interest rate provided by the government is too high and the tenor of three years is too short,” he noted.<br /><br /><b>By: Anna Okon</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Governor of Benue State, Samuel Ortom, has revealed that clashes between farmers and herdsmen led to the loss of farm produce and property worth over N95bn within four years.<br /><br />He said this in an interview with newsmen in Abuja, on Thursday.<br /><br />According to the governor, the losses, which included those incurred by Fulani herdsmen, were recorded in clashes that took place between 2012 and 2016.<br /><br />He explained that his administration’s decision to end the senseless killings and wanton destruction of property informed the passage of the anti-open grazing bill into law.&nbsp; The governor also revealed that threats issued by a splinter group of Miyyeti Allah Cattle Breeders Association formed part of the last discussions he had with President Muhammadu Buhari when he paid him a visit at the Aso Rock Villa recently.<br /><br />Ortom said no amount of threats or intimidation was strong enough to dissuade the state from implementing the anti-open grazing law with effect from November 1, this year.<br /><br />He said, “What we have done is legitimate; it was an executive bill which we sent to the Benue State House of Assembly, we went through the due process before the law was passed and assented to by me.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yGRtReVWbp4/WezdScEXjCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/UwwktZ-iJv4XeLJhn2lbLBGkT5wQGz6JQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Ortom.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"334\" data-original-width=\"250\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-yGRtReVWbp4/WezdScEXjCI/AAAAAAAAAgc/UwwktZ-iJv4XeLJhn2lbLBGkT5wQGz6JQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Ortom.jpg\" width=\"239\" /></a></div><br />“As many as are not ready to abide by our laws are free to move from Benue State to other states where open grazing is allowed.<br /><br />“I have called for the arrest of Abdullahi Bello, the president and Sale Hassan, the secretary of the splinter group of Miyetti Allah who have issued threats. I understand that they are galvanising people at the border with Cameroon and in Nasarawa, but we will not be deterred. They don’t have a monopoly of violence or acquiring weapons; it is against the law. We in Benue are law-abiding people and we expect that security agencies will do their work.”<br /><br />While explaining the reason behind the recent truce entered into with labour unions in the state, the governor said his administration had to borrow N8bn from commercial banks to settle two months’ salaries.<br /><br />He stressed that the state’s wage bill, which currently stands at about N7.8bn, was not sustainable and that his administration was doing everything possible to bring it down to N4bn at the most.<br /><br /><b>By: John Alechenu,</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Agricultural experts believe many farmers make the following mistakes:<br /><br /><b>Farmers growing too many crops</b><br /><br />Your farm will fail if you refuse to focus specifically on crop that bring you the most cash. Cultivating too many crops that are not economically viable will soon put you out of business because at the end of the day you will be struggling to recover from loses year in, year out until the farm finally crashes.<br /><br />Secondly, do you grow what the market wants or are you growing what you want. If you grow what you want, you may not have a space in the market to sell your product at good prices.<br /><br /><b>Not taking farming as a business</b><br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ufaUdMUr8c/WdcysZOWGuI/AAAAAAAAAQU/xNE0AEWEzb05NoT3i7P0ATQPp7jASlu-ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers-planting-seedlings.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2ufaUdMUr8c/WdcysZOWGuI/AAAAAAAAAQU/xNE0AEWEzb05NoT3i7P0ATQPp7jASlu-ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Farmers-planting-seedlings.jpg\" /></a></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div>A former minister of agriculture and current President of the African Development Bank, Dr Akinwumi Adesina, always advised farmers to see farming as a business not a development issue, as that is the only way to make money and be sustainable. He argued that most small farmers fail because they fail to treat farming as a business.&nbsp; As a small holder farmer, if you want to make money from your farm,&nbsp; you “need to pay attention to the bottom line if you want the venture to be sustainable over a long period of time,” a Canadian Urban Farmer Curtis Stone said.<br /><br /><b>You don’t have a sustainable agribusiness plan</b><br /><br />Before you undertake any farming venture, you need to have a business plan bringing into consideration all the element of production and marketing. The practice these days is that “farmers start farming and then try to mold a business around that, versus conceptualizing a business, creating a plan, and then executing.” If you have a sustainable business model and build the farm around the model, the chances that you will succeed are high.<br /><br /><b>You do not have the time to monitor the farm closely or spend some quality time in the farm</b><br /><br />This is one of the major factors that kill many farms. Many smallholder farmers who are urban people have little time to spend on their farms to monitor any new development. There are people who hardly visit their farms in a week and even when they do, they don’t have time to scrutinise everything in the farm. They engage others to look after the farm for them without even putting them in check. Such a farm will not survive long.<br /><br /><b>Not seeking knowledge of your production area continuously</b><br /><br />As a farmer, you must update your knowledge regularly in order to be a master in what you do. This will help you improve your production capacity and expand your marketing networks. You won’t grow if you don’t interact with people (producing the same thing) regularly and learn from what they are doing better.<br /><br /><b>&nbsp;Waiting to have a product to sell before building the marketing strategy</b><br /><br />If you wait until you have a product at hand before selling, you will have problem. “You can actually start marketing your farm and building an audience from day one. Don’t expect people to be lined up out the door just because you have product to sell,” Stone advised.<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

    "title": "Subsidizing Agriculture only Way to Food Security – Taraba Chief",
    "content": "<br />The Federal Government has been advised to fully subsidise agriculture to enable farmers make profit and for Nigeria to realise food security<br /><br />The advice was given by the chief of Mutum-Biyu chiefdom in Taraba State, Alhaji Sani Kachalla, in an interview with Daily Trust. He said Nigerians have answered the call by President Buhari to embark on increased agricultural activities but noted that high cost of farm inputs and fake chemicals and fertiliser were hampering the efforts.<br /><br />The traditional leader, who is also a large-scale farmer, disclosed that because of high cost of farm inputs, many farmers would not make profit from their produce this year. According to him, fake chemicals and fertiliser were sold to farmers across the state which not only increased cost to the farmers, but also resulted in low yield of many crops.<br /><br />He said the cost of producing 100kg bag of maize was more than N12,000 and the current price of a bag of the produce is now between N4,000 and N6,000 in most parts of the state.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZwzXYCiuISc/WfGnxxQOEPI/AAAAAAAAAj0/j-1tt8BuJ2IM8xHPVUfVziKoK_tn0VvgACLcBGAs/s1600/Maize.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ZwzXYCiuISc/WfGnxxQOEPI/AAAAAAAAAj0/j-1tt8BuJ2IM8xHPVUfVziKoK_tn0VvgACLcBGAs/s320/Maize.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Alhaji Sani Kachalla explained that the news now making the round that the Federal Government has imported maize from India will further worsen the fortunes of farmers, especially maize farmers in the country.<br /><br />“If the Federal Government wants farmers to remain in the farming business, it must subsidise farm inputs and also reintroduce marketing board,” he advised, adding that in advanced economies, agriculture was subsidised apart from other incentives given to farmers by governments.<br /><br />The traditional ruler stated further that the federal and states governments have no option than to fully involve in agriculture as is done in most countries that have food security.<br /><br />Alhaji Sani warned that many farmers would abandon farming if government failed to address the problem of high cost of farm inputs and provide good markets for farm produce. He said farmers were left at the mercy of middlemen who made bulk purchases of farm produce during harvest and sold during scarcity to make profit more than the farmers.<br /><br />“Those advising the Federal Government not to subsidise agriculture or government to remove its hand completely are doing so for their personal interest and such advice will hamper achieving the food security ambition of the Federal Government,” he cautioned.<br /><br /><b>By Magaji Isa Hunkuyi,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Cowpea Harvest Threatened as Insects Infest Benue Farms",
    "content": "Owners of cowpea farms like this are fighting back insect infections in the state.<br /><br />Farmers in Benue State have expressed worry over the parasitic insects infestation of most cowpea (beans) farms which are threatening their harvest expected in the next few weeks.<br /><br />Our correspondent who visited some cowpea farms in the state reports that the tiny black-looking insects have already affected the pod bearers such that if not adequately controlled at the current stage may spoil the seeds.<br /><br />At Vitalis Tarnongu’s one and half hectare of cowpea farm along the University of Agriculture road in Makurdi, the insects have completely ravaged the plants which are fruiting at advanced stage and likely to be ready for harvest in 15 days’ time.<br /><br />Tarnongu said he had tried using a particular chemical to control the insect but that did not work, fearing that the infestation would make further progress into the pods to spoil the seeds.<br /><br />“You can see that 97 percent of the farm is covered with the termites. It is going to spoil the seed or change the colour and that would affect my harvest and the income expected to be generated,” he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xqQDHo_8oCc/WfGmObfxT3I/AAAAAAAAAjg/bGd77FaOTcUDuQwzlMeQfIlnqwvFmvVfwCLcBGAs/s1600/Cowpeas.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-xqQDHo_8oCc/WfGmObfxT3I/AAAAAAAAAjg/bGd77FaOTcUDuQwzlMeQfIlnqwvFmvVfwCLcBGAs/s320/Cowpeas.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />According to him, if the harvest turns out good as earlier expected, then at least 50 bags would be harvested from one hectare of the farm since the seed planted was a special one being test run for multiplication next year.<br /><br />“Like I said earlier, if everything goes well, I would have a minimum harvest of 50 bags per hectare. This farm is a special seed being test-run for multiplication and a bag of seed after harvest sells for as much as N80,000. So you multiply that amount by 50 bags, then you realise how much income would go down the drain in the event of poor harvest,” Tarnongu added.<br /><br />Another cowpea farmer in Ugboju-Otukpo area of the state, Ejembi Audu, said his farm already fruiting has been affected as well and that he didn’t know what kind of chemical to use to fight the insects.<br /><br />Audu also feared that his harvest from the three hectare of cowpea farm may not amount to much despite the effort made to acquire improved seeds and cultivating same with the hope of getting bumper harvest.<br /><br />He said: “I don’t know how this harvest would turn out. I wanted bumper harvest and went for improved seed. But now, this parasitic infestation would likely ruin my harvest.”<br /><br />Apart from Tarnongu and Audu, other local cowpea farmers in different parts of the state have also fingered the same problem on their fields.<br /><br />However, a scientist and seed merchant at Syngeta Nigeria Limited, Mr. Akor Emmanuel, has said there was no need to worry as the black insect which he identified as cowpea “aphids” could be effectively tackled with systematic insecticides application alongside best agronomy practice.<br /><br />Emmanuel, taking a clue from Tarnongu’s farm, maintained that the cowpea plant was at its fruiting stage and that the infestation he had seen could diminish harvest if not controlled immediately.<br /><br />“It can affect an entire harvest. The insects are now at the pupa stage and could migrate to the larvae before becoming full-fledged insects. The insects have been on the soil and very stubborn. It requires an advanced form of insecticides to control the infestation on the farm,” Emmanuel said.<br /><br />But Tarnongu, who insisted that his farm was well managed and protected against any infestation until the current development, appealed to government to help farmers as he noted that poor farmers cannot afford the cost of fighting against the insects following the high cost of the chemicals recommended by experts.<br /><br />On his part, the Benue State chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Aondona Hembe Kuhe, admitted that the infestation constitutes a common problem for cowpea farmers in the state this year.<br /><br />He said AFAN has advised its members to use chemicals approved by the agriculture ministry to mitigate against the challenge since the insects appeared too stubborn to succumb to some variety of the chemicals already used on the affected farms.<br /><br />Kuhe who decried the high cost of chemicals and poverty rate among the farmers, stressed that the development would lead to low harvest as he noted, the insects attacked the cowpea seeds such that it wouldn’t produce well and thereby reducing expected bumper production.<br /><br />Similarly, the Commissioner for Agriculture and Natural Resources, James Anbua, stated that the challenge was common to cowpea farmers in the state this year but that there were control mechanisms already in place to deal with the situation.<br /><br />“It is a common problem because cowpea is attractive to insects. Some chemicals which are not harmful are available in the ministry for farmers to spread around their farm environment. They should do the spraying when the plants are flowering.<br /><br />“However, it (insect) is attacking some farms but not ravaging. It will affect harvest as well but the effect would not be drastic. We have the control mechanism,” Anbua stressed.<br /><br />Meanwhile, an Associate Professor of Plant Breeding and Seed Science, Dr. Lucky Omoigui, of the Federal University of Agriculture (FUAM) in Makurdi has advised cowpea farmers to always get their seeds from the institution.<br /><br />Omoigui assured on helping to tackle the menace after on the spot assessment of some of the farms infested so that farmers can derive high returns.<br /><br /><b>By Hope Abah,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Why Farmers Should Consider Drip Irrigation",
    "content": "<br />According to expert views, drip irrigation is a system whereby you give water or fertiliser directly to the root zone of plants, eliminating runoff, evaporation, and drift. It is a technique in which water flows through a filter into special drip pipes, with emitters located at different spacing.<br /><br />Mr Adebowole Onafowora, an agricultural entrepreneur explained that drip irrigation increases oxygen level at the root zone by more than 100 times, adding that although oxygen is not a major nutrient of plants, it aids them in absorbing nutrients and water.<br /><br />Setting up a drip irrigation system for one’s farm involves connecting pipes namely drip lines or drip tapes and then water is released through the emitters, releasing about 1.5 litres to 20 litres of water per day depending on the water requirement of the crop.<br /><br />The different types of emitters for irrigation include; micro emitters, porous emitters which are inbuilt from factory, and free flow emitters also inbuilt from factory, or improvised emitters from used water bottle containers and other suitable materials. He said a hectare of land requires N100,000 to N150,000 to do it yourself and with a little extra if you are hiring a professional.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eLM3ryMf4hU/WfGkxaPoUeI/AAAAAAAAAjU/acYZWGGLWaQB5T9uU_sgwX3NfKB1HaGhQCLcBGAs/s1600/Drip%2BIrrigation.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-eLM3ryMf4hU/WfGkxaPoUeI/AAAAAAAAAjU/acYZWGGLWaQB5T9uU_sgwX3NfKB1HaGhQCLcBGAs/s320/Drip%2BIrrigation.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />On type of drips to use, he explained that the crop to be grown is the first thing to consider when going into drip irrigation, adding that drip lines that have stronger pipes and hose can last for up to three years or more.<br /><br />Adebowole listed types of drip lines to include; the arrow head drip line which is best for root crops or crops that are heavy feeders like tomato, cucumber and pepper, adding that it has been designed to go into the root zone. Then there are, surface drip lines suitable for crops like watermelon and vegetables and drip tapes used majorly for irrigation only because it is not so good for fertiliser (fertigation).<br /><br />The mist spraying drip which is an overhead drip line spraying water from the top is mostly used for foliar irrigation/fertigation of vegetables and leafy crops, he said. He warned that the emitters can get clogged especially when you use it for fertigation and bush burning burns drip lines because they are made of plastic.<br /><br /><b>By Safina Buhari</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Federal government on Wednesday said the yams that were reportedly rejected were the United Kingdom were not certified by the Nigerian Agriculture Quarantine Service (NAQS) before it was exported.<br /><br />Addressing journalists in Abuja, the Coordinating Director of NAQS, Dr Vincent Isegbe, said the exporter exported yams to U.K without getting certification from the Quarantine Service.<br /><br />It will be recalled that recently, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, flagged off the exportation yam to the United Kingdom in Lagos State.<br /><br />Meanwhile there were media reports that the yams exported to the United States were rejected, but the Dr Isegbe said the yams sent to United States were not rejected, instead the yams exported to United Kingdom were rejected because they decayed before getting to its destination.<br /><br />He said the yams that were exported to the United States which passed through the inspection and certification NAQS were not rejected.<br /><br />Dr Isegbe however explained that the yams were not actually rejected in the UK, but because it took the yams months before it got to UK, which eventually led to the yams decaying before getting to its destination.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZuqOyr-3fM/Wehd6FoxvdI/AAAAAAAAAew/YjaFakzYeYIYxfM-In-JPuGaxxBECgLCACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Yam.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZuqOyr-3fM/Wehd6FoxvdI/AAAAAAAAAew/YjaFakzYeYIYxfM-In-JPuGaxxBECgLCACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Yam.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />ICYMI: Yam export will cause scarcity – Yams Farmers Association<br /><br />“The exporter to US agreed and went through Quarantine inspection and certification, the exporter to the U.K by the time we start the inspection, the next morning we didn’t see his cargo, so we did not inspect his cargo”, he said<br /><br />He explained that cargo was not available for us to inspect as at the time we did for the one for US consignment, that was the reason why the consignment was delayed in the UK for three weeks because there was no Quarantine clearance.<br /><br />“The story is that a Nigerian exporting yam to the United Kingdom, the video shown that at that point, the yams have gotten worse, the man clearly mentioned that when he put the yam in the container, it took about a week before it was put into the ship, and the shipping line did not carry the consignment to the UK until after 3 months, so naturally, yam being what it is could not survive such carriage and it ended up being bad, so it is just a logistics issue with the person that shipped the yam for him”, Dr Isegbe noted.<br /><br />Advising potential exporters of yam, Dr Isegbe said “for yam, we do not advice you to go the open market to buy yam to export, it is not advisable, you need Quarantine guidance, once you come to Quarantine we sit down with you, we interview you and guide you properly and give you the guideline so that you can go home with it.<br /><br />“If somebody wants to export, the first point of call is the market before thinking of getting the yam to supply to the market, if you have the market, then you know where the commodities are going to, so you approach the NAQS and tell them the location the yam is going because in the phyto-Sanitary certificate for any agricultural product, the exporter with the destination will have to be quoted in the certificate, then we will now tell you how to get the correct commodity to export”.<br /><br /><b>By:Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Mushroom Farming for Smallholders",
    "content": "<br /><br />With mushroom cultivation new to Nigeria, many entrepreneurs want to start small with a pilot project before investing substantial capital. This makes sense and is entirely possible.<br /><br />Every week I get enquiries from people wanting to start mushroom farming, but on a limited scale. “How can this be done without a large investment?” they ask. Most are smallholders with limited space. If you’re in this situation, one of the best ways to start out is by building a small dark room with tarpaulin and palm front.<br /><br />This makes even higher operations feasible, enabling you to grow mushroom in all seasons, and allowing for their fast growth.<br /><br />Small greenhouse tunnels 10m to 15m long and 8m wide are readily available from local suppliers and should cost between N40, 000 and N50,000.<br /><br /><b>Getting started</b><br /><br />Starting a mushroom farm is a potentially lucrative way of getting into the farming business.&nbsp; Its cultivation is also regarded as one of the most science-based branches of agriculture and horticulture. Growing mushroom is a rewarding experience.<br /><br />Not only can it be used for your dining table, you might also be able to develop great relationships with individuals, health food stores, hotels and food caterers; if you have a small space to create a small farm.<br /><br /><b>Health benefits&nbsp;</b><br /><br />Edible mushrooms are considered as healthy food because their mineral content is higher than that of meat or fish and most vegetables. The protein content of fresh mushrooms is about twice that of vegetables and four times that of oranges.<br /><br />Mushrooms contain proteins which have all the nine amino-acids that are essential for our health.<br /><br />It is clear that apart from the nutritional value of mushrooms, they have potential medicinal benefits and are also an ideal food for diabetic and obesed people.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nwsxi9YwOe8/WfGSQVvgMrI/AAAAAAAAAjE/tBv56RimwQ8I73CsE_reeJxOLWfhXdm1wCLcBGAs/s1600/Mushroom.JPG\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"408\" data-original-width=\"766\" height=\"170\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Nwsxi9YwOe8/WfGSQVvgMrI/AAAAAAAAAjE/tBv56RimwQ8I73CsE_reeJxOLWfhXdm1wCLcBGAs/s320/Mushroom.JPG\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br /><b>Good market</b><br /><br />Many opportunities abound in the production of mushrooms as many hospitality industries in the country still import the product to add to their meals. Majority of big hotels in Nigeria have mushrooms in their daily menu, but this mushroom came from abroad.<br /><br />It means that local production will have a ready market. Cultivation of mushrooms involves mainly the use of agricultural waste without the use of chemicals and it appears safe.<br /><br /><b>Increased awareness</b><br /><br />More farmers are of late going into the farming of mushrooms, a neglected and forgotten healthy food, which is not only improving the financial status of the producers but the health of the consumers as well.<br /><br />The rate at which Nigerians have shown interest in the eating of mushrooms is given a massive boost to production of the delicacy.<br /><br />Local demand for mushroom is increasing as the people become more health conscious by avoiding the consumption of red meat that is loaded with cholesterol.<br /><br /><b>Viability</b><br /><br />The technology for the cultivation of mushroom species could be easily adopted by individuals, co-operative societies, families, farmers, schools in the rural and urban centres without difficulties.<br /><br />The cultivation of the mushroom can be done all year round as sources of the mushrooms are from agricultural wastes which are always available in abundance in Nigeria.<br /><br />Additionally, while a kilo of chicken goes for N1,000 on the average in Nigeria, a kilo of mushroom is N3,000. Mushroom beds need a dark environment for only 14 to18 days while harvesting is usually four to five days after opening the white-bags. Mature mushrooms become ready for harvesting in another four days.<br /><br /><b>Professional reliable mushroom service</b><br /><br />Choosing the kind of mushroom is important because growing techniques vary depending on type.<br /><br />At Jovana farms, we produce and sell mushroom spawns (seeds), spraying equipment, compost bags, fresh and dried mushroom. We also train and help people set up their mushroom farms.<br /><br />My advice to intending farmers is to attend a training course for mushroom growing and cautiously selects a service provider and use hygienic mushroom substrate.<br /><br />Those who cannot attend our seminars can order for the self-tutorial VCD and book, and train themselves. The primary objective is to bring this golden opportunity to the door step of every Nigerian as a very sure and potent means of conquering poverty.<br /><br />Contact us for consultancy or attend Jovana Farms seminars nearest to you and discover more opportunities in mushroom cultivation!

    "title": "Exporters Debunk Yam Rejection Reports",
    "content": "<br />The exporters of yam to the UK and US have disputed the reports, initially aired by the Africa Independent Television (AIT) purporting that the yams exported after the official flag-off ceremony on June 29, 2017 were rejected at their export destinations.<br /><br />The symbolic event, done at the Lilypond Container Terminal in Lagos by the Honourable Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, meant to boost the morale of Nigerian exporters and make a bold statement to the global marketplace, has drawn widespread criticisms on various media platforms based on the misleading reports.<br /><br />The concerned exporters and other prospective exporters have expressed worries about the potential impact of the negative publicity on their prospects at the export market in the wake of federal government’s initiative on diversification of the economy through agricultural produce export.<br /><br />Most commentators and analysts in the mainstream and social media have retailed the negative aspect of the laudable initiative and have played up the wrong versions of the export story. Discussions with the exporters have since shown the prevailing storyline as inappropriate and misleading.<br /><br />First, the exporters to the UK and US have emphatically said that their consignments were successfully cleared at the ports and delivered them to their various warehouses. They said, although some cases of tuber spoilage were reported in both cases, these were separated from the good ones, and the good ones were distributed to the buyers. The exporters noted that Ghana, which has been exporting yams for a while, routinely records cases of spoilage, without making any public issues therefrom; and their yams don’t get rejected as a result.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/FNwUTFazFfwOQB1iuc0hPAgHEpUUolY_wCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Mr. Michael Adedipe of ADES UK Foods and Drinks for the UK, whose warehouse was visited by AIT, has deplored the AIT report and other subsequent commentaries about rejection of his yams by the UK authorities. Adedipe has said emphatically that the consignment was not rejected; “It was cleared.”<br /><br />According to Adedipe, who confirmed that he spoke to AIT: “I’ve watched the (TV) programme which lasted for about two hours. All the positive stuff removed. We that decide to venture in this project are aware of the risks involved because, this fresh produce … we’ll expect five or 10 per cent damages. I don’t know why they said the product got rejected. I’ve sent my release note. I’ve sent video of loading. I’ve sent every documentation to say that there is no issue like that at all.”<br /><br />On the spoilage of yam, Adedipe explained that “the failure has nothing to do with the ministry of agriculture, but the Nigerian Ports Authority. That’s where I see the failure.” He expressed disgust at the mishandling of his comments by the AIT reporter, saying: “I told him, he is aware of it. He knew about the delay, I told him about all the consignment. He knew every single thing that happened. But what he did the most is to use all the negative stuff. We talked about other things. I told him how I came into the UK to go and fix our problem. All those were removed from the report.”<br /><br />Adedipe, who has vowed not to stop yam export business, disclosed that “the other mistake was the shipping line we used. But they were the ones that were available.” According to him, in spite of the sour experience with media report, “I’m willing to invest. I still expect…at least to take a container from Nigeria every week.”<br /><br />Managing Director, Wan Nyikwagh Farms Nigeria Limited, Mr Yandev Amaabai, has strongly disputed the yam rejection story and said it doesn’t even tally. “The story from AIT was focused on UK. So far, I am the only person who has lifted yam to the US. Whatever we can do to clarify this issue will be good. We learn as we progress. The whole idea that government brought was to diversify the economy.”<br /><br />My goods actually got to the US on September 7, 2017. The ship berthed on September 2, 2017, but, because of the flooding in Texas, we couldn’t discharge until the 7th. They were cleared from the Customs and brought to the warehouse on the 7th. Yams are perishable items and, definitely, some may go bad on the way. But, this statement that says the American government rejected Nigerian yams, where does it come from?<br /><br />Our yams were released to us and we took them to the stores. We sorted out our yams when they got there. We distributed them to the off-takers. So, where they got this story from, I don’t know. Nobody has ever called from anywhere, even in the US, to ask me question. If a few yams got rotten, and I am not complaining, why are people crying more than the owner? I have all the papers. The Customs cleared my goods on the other side. And these things went to my warehouse from where we distributed.”<br /><br />If Ghana, which produces 4.8 million tonnes of yams, according to 2008 estimates, occupies a niche as the leading exporter of crop, accounting for over 94 per cent of total yam exports in West Africa, Nigeria which is by far the world’s largest producer of yams, accounting for over 70 to 76 per cent of the world production, producing 35.017 million metric tonnes valued equivalent of US$5.654 billion by the 2008 estimates should do better than Ghana in the export market<br /><br />Ghana is the first country in West Africa to launch its national yam development strategy in 2013. The country aims at US$5billion dollars of exports by 2018. Nigeria, which produces seven times Ghana’s production volume, is beset with criticisms over attempts to bring it to the global yam markets. About 90 per cent of Ghana’s yams are exported to the US, Canada, UK and elsewhere in Europe. There are more Nigerians than Ghanaians in these countries, meaning more prospects for Nigerian exporters.<br /><br />Chief Ogbeh has said that Nigeria, the largest producer of yam in the world, is not anywhere near the capacity to export and remains so much a nation of consumers. He stressed that “Nigeria must export” as the “country’s economy is increasing, and in ten years’ time, oil and gas is going to drop. Then we may have nothing to earn foreign exchange except we begin to diversify our export base now.”<br /><br />With all these prospects in view, the Honourable Minister expressed surprise at the negative news trailing his laudable effort at putting Nigeria on the global yam export market, saying “we’re not going to stop because this is not enough to demoralise us. We have food to export. Never mind what so-called critics are doing.”<br /><br />“In the ministry of agriculture,” he said, “we are not exporters. The ministry does not export. We’re going to talk to the port authority on cooling vans for vegetables and fresh produce so that exporters don’t lose money and we don’t lose face. We should begin to build cold trucks that are temperature-controlled to keep the yams till the time they have to go. We should invest in special containers for their storage.”<br /><br />“If other countries are doing it, we too can do it. We’re trying to take over the market. We’ve come to nearly 70 per cent of raw output of yams. Why can’t Nigerians in Texas, Canada, London and Germany have access to the yams?” The Minister vowed that “we will go ahead with our efforts to export yam. We will not let this opportunity slip any further. We are determined to position our people to capture the investment opportunities and benefits in the yam export to these countries. We will fix the yam export value chain. We have the volume and the market.”<br /><br />We will emphasise global best practices, engage with world class experts and international organisations as well as leverage the strength in indigenous knowledge. We will support investment in relevant infrastructure and facilities. We will revive the abandoned yam conditioning centres in Ekiti and Nassarawa states while we encourage the construction of new ones with appropriate equipment to boost storage and export prospects. We appeal to Nigerians, in the spirit of patriotism, to see the silver lining around the cloud of the week of misinformation about yam export.<br /><br />We have commenced engagement with the National Assembly for the repeal of the 1989 law that prohibits export of yams and other agro-commodities. Currently, the bill has passed the second reading at the National Assembly. The continued existence of this law is an obstruction against the economic diversification and export initiative of this administration. We plead with the National Assembly to fast-track the repeal of the law and help us further unlock our export potential.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Daylight News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Forestry Research Institute of Nigeria (FRIN) is looking beyond environmental sustainability to find ways of empowering people via improved forest species.<br /><br />Speaking on the sidelines of the 11th National Council on Environment (NCE) held in Ogun State recently, the Executive Director of FRIN, Dr Adeshola Adepoju, said that arising from discussion held during meetings at the event, the institute was “looking beyond sustaining the environment.<br /><br />“We are looking at how from the environment we can support the Federal Government’s direction on economic recovery; how various wastes can be turned to wealth, how afforestation can be an economic way of life, collaborating with communities and bringing pupils and students of schools to be part of afforestation and reforestation.<br /><br />“It is not just about just sustaining the environment, we are doing a conscientious advocacy to let people know that beyond living healthy in your environment, you can also live wealthy.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-e7M-4m0T3J4/We8G63YMn5I/AAAAAAAAAh8/YCbtGOlp088X8Pv98TMBNyHtJrGmL5hVQCLcBGAs/s1600/FRIN-MD.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-e7M-4m0T3J4/We8G63YMn5I/AAAAAAAAAh8/YCbtGOlp088X8Pv98TMBNyHtJrGmL5hVQCLcBGAs/s320/FRIN-MD.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />He said that among the non-timber forest products that were on display at the institute’s exhibition stand at the NCE was an improved variety of shea butter that becomes harvestable in two to seven years.<br /><br />“In terms of reforestation and afforestation, we have been able to solve a major problem that farmers are facing in the area of not wanting to wait 10, 20, or 30 years’ time for a tree to mature. We have been able to come up with the vegetative propagation of some indigenous tree species that can come to full maturity in terms of fruiting or gestation in the seventh year at maximum.<br /><br />“One of them is shea butter tree. People use the wood for charcoal and making items like mortar and pestle. Now we have come up with a species that is friendlier on the environment and you cannot cut to do anything, but at the end of the seventh year is fruiting and the shea butter product can be used for making body cream, skin treatment and the like.”<br /><br />He said that “This is so that people can see that they can plan a business and begin to yield their interest in seven years maximum, rather than the past adage that the one who plants a tree is not the one who harvests it.”<br /><br /><b>By: Paul Omorogbe</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "FG Rice Programme Runs into Storm in C-River",
    "content": "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN, Anchor- Borrowers scheme for farmers sponsored by the Federal Government has suffered a critical setback in Cross River State with hundreds of farmers bitterly complaining about the inept handling by state government officials. Exasperated farmers across the state bared their minds in separate interactive sessions with the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Agriculture, Cross River, Pastor Justin Ugbe, who went round the three senatorial zones of the state to meet with&nbsp; participants on why the programme failed.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bags of rice They informed him that the scheme on the scheme did not&nbsp; meet the expected target on rice production and loan repayment by farmers because of conspicuous lapses. Denied access to financial component Mr. David Esese, who spoke on behalf of&nbsp; farmers in the southern senatorial district, told Ugbe that&nbsp; aside from farmers in Bakassi that were able to access the financial component of the loan, others in the remaining&nbsp; six local government areas in the southern part of the state were not given the agreed&nbsp; money to facilitate the planting of their rice farms.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">His words: “Majority of us got the rice input, but the fertilizers were distributed haphazardly with some getting the urea and others NPK. Some&nbsp; got the chemicals while others did not get and nobody was given the&nbsp; financial component of the loan, apart from Bakassi farmers.” He said farmers visited the Bank of Agriculture&nbsp; at Obubra several times to get the financial component of the loan, but were not given, a situation that frustrated their efforts to cultivate the hectares&nbsp; of swamp already&nbsp; earmarked for their farms.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dYxPp5Y3uyo/WeieqnfS7kI/AAAAAAAAAf4/3xVXRCVcBh0tSaLYoLGBTVs1Cs0vFzmQQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Grain%2BReserves.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"269\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dYxPp5Y3uyo/WeieqnfS7kI/AAAAAAAAAf4/3xVXRCVcBh0tSaLYoLGBTVs1Cs0vFzmQQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Grain%2BReserves.jpeg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Rice didn’t sprout In Ogoja, the representative of the farmers, Osborn Kanjal, said the rice distributed to them as inputs did not germinate owing to the long period the rice was stored before cultivation. “We were given the rice in September, 2016 and by that time, the rice season had passed and so we kept the rice for the 2017 rice planting season, but by the time we planted the rice, it refused to germinate owing to heat that affected it because of the long storage period,” he disclosed. Kanjal said over 90 per cent of the farmers in the northern senatorial district of the state&nbsp; could not access the financial component of the loan, as the Bank of Agriculture in Ogoja said the money was held up at the headquarters&nbsp; in Kaduna.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shortchanged “We agreed in a meeting with the Commissioner for Agriculture, Professor Eneji that the farmers should get the sum of N230, 000 per hectre,&nbsp; but those who were lucky to access the money got only N90, 000 per hectare and the Committee claimed that N120, 000 was used for the inputs, which were way too high. Even at that, majority of us did not get the money, so from which source do we pay back the loan?” He queried.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">The farmers called for extension of the loan repayment period from 2017 to 2018 to enable all the farmers access the money and complete inputs to cultivate their farms before repayment. Perm sec speaks The permanent secretary&nbsp; explained that the scheme was taken from the Ministry of Agriculture and given to a Committee, headed by Mr Godwin Akwaji, the Special Adviser to the Governor on Revenue, adding that most officials of the ministry were not conversant with developments linked to the scheme until the outcry by the farmers, Mute Efforts by our reporter to speak with Mr Akwaji did not yield results as he neither picked calls to his GSM phone&nbsp; &nbsp;nor responded&nbsp; &nbsp;to text messages.</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>By Emmanuel Una</b></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Vanguard News</b></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Banking&Finance : Stakeholders Open up on CBN’s Agric, Other Loans",
    "content": "<div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Just as the disbursement of the N26 billion Agriculture/Small and Medium Enterprises (AGSME) fund is set to commence, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) should bend over backwards to ensure that the facility gets to its beneficiaries.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">This was the wish of an agro-enterpreneur, Mrs Yemisi Iranloye, the Managing Director of Psaltry International Limited, Iseyin, Oyo State, while advising the apex bank on how to make its intervention schemes achieve their objectives. Recall that “the objective of the AGSME is to catalyze growth in SMEs to ease access to finance; build capacity in the agriculture and SME sectors, create jobs and ultimately to improve prosperity”, according to Mrs Bola Adesola, the Managing Director of Standard Chartered Bank, while speaking on the initiative recently in Lagos after a Bankers’ Committee meeting. AGSME is a brainchild of the Committee in collaboration with the CBN, the highest contributor to the fund.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">At its launch last year during the Bankers’ Committee Retreat in Lagos, the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said that the scheme would “dwell on improving the productivity of farmers, manufacturers and firms, as well as their access to finance, in order to produce goods and services that can be made in Nigeria, thereby improving job creation and growth for the nation as a whole.” Emefiele stated that the two sectors –agriculture and the manufacturing- were central to the the country’s efforts at revitalising the economy.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BUxGVyVpXfU/WdcyZphpXEI/AAAAAAAAAQU/iHfehWpqdMIN1Uetnd7Gpl2L9Z1GUsdWQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Bank%2Bof%2BIndustry.png\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"500\" height=\"224\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BUxGVyVpXfU/WdcyZphpXEI/AAAAAAAAAQU/iHfehWpqdMIN1Uetnd7Gpl2L9Z1GUsdWQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Bank%2Bof%2BIndustry.png\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">“They are recognised worldwide as catalysts for rapid growth, job creation and poverty reduction. Agriculture, for example, remains the largest employer of labour in Nigeria and contributes about 24.2 per cent of our GDP,” he stated. It has been said times without number that Nigerian agriculture has high potential, but actualizing it depends on concerted efforts to address the major challenges confronting the sector.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">“These include access to finance, particularly, by small scale farmers who currently dominate the sector”, stated Dr (Mrs) Grace Evbuomwan, a senior lecturer at the Department of Banking &amp; Finance, Covenant University, Ota, Ogun State. According to her, “the level of funding that the agricultural sector had received over the years have not been adequate. Both the government and the financial institutions in the country have not given the agricultural sector adequate attention, despite its importance. “Consequently, the Nigerian agricultural sector have not been able to perform its assigned roles in economic development sustainably.”&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">That was the reason, Emefiele observed: “For quite some time now, funding the necessary investment required for the transformation of the agriculture and manufacturing sectors has become a major priority of the CBN.” Commenting on the AGSME fund pending disbursement, Mrs Tomi Somefun, the Managing Director of Unity Bank Plc, said the framework for this was in the works. “This is being finalised and disbursement would start by the end of this quarter,” she added. But Mrs Iranloye, as a big time beneficiary of the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS) of CBN, expressed misgiving about the lenders’ commitment to the scheme, saying: “The banks, sometimes, may not be willing to take customers down that road.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don’t forget, it pays the banks to give you their own money than for you to take CBN fund. For me, I think the CBN should take a step further to publish how people can get its loan.” This must have taken Dr. Mudashiru Olaitan, a Director at the Development Finance Department of the apex bank, off guard when he said that the Nigerian financial institutions in the country are expected to promote capital formation, grow and develop the real sector by promoting agriculture, trade and industry, finance infrastructure and influence economic activities through the provision of affordable lending costs.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The apex bank, however, will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of its existing development finance initiatives such as those in agriculture, micro small and medium enterprises and export-import,” he pledged. Meanwhile, brandishing, CBN interventions so far in agriculture, Emefiele stated: “In 2015, we launched the Anchor Borrowers Programme as an innovative way of improving access to finance for farmers and manufacturers. Together with other initiatives, like the Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme and Nigerian Incentive-based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL), they are now proving to be successful in several states.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">“In Kebbi State, over 78,000 smallholder farmers are now cultivating about 100,000 hectares of rice farms. It is expected that over one million metric tonnes of rice will be produced in that state alone this year,” he added. But how can a startup access CBN funding, Iranloye said: It takes time, it takes patience. I will always advise that for a young entrepreneur, when you start, open an account and tell them this is my dream. And I want to get there in 15 months. Share it with the agric desk of your bank. Take them through it.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">Don’t just open the commercial account, that bank would be treating you as a commercial customer. When you open a commercial account, go and find out the Agric Desk of your bank. So you ‘ll be interfacing with the Agric Desk. It is the agric desk that will do the paper work and present it to the bank management asking for CACS loan(for example) for a customer. Otherwise, if you say I just want loan, the commercial manager would give you a commercial loan.&nbsp;</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>So most people don’t have the knowledge of what to do?&nbsp; Where do I go? How do I access the CBN funding?&nbsp;</b></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\">“For me, I think the CBN should take a step further to publish how people can get its loan. You can’t get the CBN loan without going through the agric desk of your bank.”</div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><br /></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>By Omodele Adigun</b></div><div style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>Sun News</b></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Climate change: Oxfam Canvasses Govt’s Support for Women Farmers",
    "content": "<br />Oxfam has said that in its analysis of policies and public investments in six countries, it has found that women farmers are not getting the resources they need to feed their families and communities and adapt to climate change.<br /><br />“This exposes a sham in the rhetoric and commitments by countries and donors to shore up the agricultural sector and to focus support on women farmers,” the organisation said.<br /><br />According to the organisation, the findings come in a year of rising hunger, fuelled by conflicts and super-charged weather events, and that having looked at agricultural policies and public investments in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, and Tanzania, it has found two major problems.<br /><br />&nbsp;“First, very little money is going to support small-scale farmers and helping them become more resilient to climate change. Second, it’s almost impossible to know how much is really reaching women farmers, a group especially threatened by climate change,” Oxfam said.<br /><br />&nbsp;The Head of Oxfam’s GROW Campaign, Rashmi Mistry, was quoted to have said that climate change was no longer a far-off threat.<br /><br />Mistry said, “It’s here now and putting lives in danger. Governments are breaking their promises to give more resources to farmers. Women on the front line of climate change can’t continue to struggle on while waiting for money to trickle down to them.<br /><br />&nbsp;“Investing directly in women farmers not only helps them and their families; it bolsters the food security for entire communities. Oxfam is calling on donor governments to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement and step up their funding aimed at helping communities adapt to climate change.<br /><br />“Developing countries must increase funding specifically for women farmers. African countries must also honour the Maputo Declaration that commits 10 per cent of all government spending to go on agriculture development.”<br /><br />These commitments, Oxfam noted, offered huge benefits, adding that discriminatory attitudes and policies meant women farmers would produce about 20 to 30 per cent less than men and closing this gap would lift millions out of hunger and poverty.<br /><br />The organisation said the countries investigated were all struggling to get enough climate adaptation funding.<br /><br />It said, “In Pakistan, just 26 per cent of the $1.17bn in climate finance they received in 2014 went to adaptation. Worse still, as of this May, Nigeria has received only $15m for adaptation, a sliver of what others have had. As of last year, multilateral adaptation funding for small-scale farmers totalled just $345m, far short of the many billions that estimates show developing countries will need.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D_taJxd1Ggg/WdZpnlAetTI/AAAAAAAAAKs/lEShHeMFDm01EnjOAGKhu00wJuVG-pcBwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Kebbi.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-D_taJxd1Ggg/WdZpnlAetTI/AAAAAAAAAKs/lEShHeMFDm01EnjOAGKhu00wJuVG-pcBwCPcBGAYYCw/s320/Kebbi.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;“To make matters worse, Oxfam found that governments do almost nothing to make sure women farmers benefit from these insufficient amounts of climate and agriculture funding. For example, in Nigeria, climate adaptation policies simply “encourage” women to participate in initiatives, but go no further. These policies do little to support the specific needs of women farmers, like improving their access to land, credit, technical training and seeds.”<br /><br />According to Oxfam, in Nigeria, volatility of prices, weather and climate change, and conflict have made access to food particularly harmful for vulnerable people and this has led to hunger and malnutrition.<br /><br />The Head of Influencing and Public Engagement, Oxfam in Nigeria, Abdulazeez Musa, said Nigeria accounted for 15 per cent of under-five child mortalities worldwide, and in the northern part of the country starvation had wiped out this age group entirely.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Any statement to the contrary is false and misguided.<br /><br />“Some of the statements and quotes credited to the Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources are false. I am currently working on importing my next consignment. Our US Department of Agriculture and Food and Drug Administration import permit is still valid.”<br /><br />Also, an expert in the agricultural sector, Prof. Joseph Ukpabi, has accused the Federal Government of not carrying out proper consultations before approving the exportation of yams from Nigeria to the United States, China and the United Kingdom.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IVOgjLdkzJI/WdcyYkEjA7I/AAAAAAAAAQY/APCQgjPhOxYv5hh7ImwsVNa0zux3hwMBQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu%2BOgbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-IVOgjLdkzJI/WdcyYkEjA7I/AAAAAAAAAQY/APCQgjPhOxYv5hh7ImwsVNa0zux3hwMBQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Audu%2BOgbeh.jpg\" /></a></div><br />In June this year, Nigeria commenced yam export to other countries as part of efforts aimed at reducing dependence on oil and increasing its revenue from agriculture.<br /><br />The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Audu Ogbeh, however raised the alarm recently when he said&nbsp; the US rejected yams from Nigeria because of their poor quality.<br /><br />To avert a reoccurrence, he said the Federal Government would increase its disciplinary measures against exporters that would embarrass Nigeria by exporting substandard items.<br /><br />Ukpabi, the Acting Director, National Root Crop Research Institute, Umudieke, Imo State,&nbsp; said the Federal Government did not involve the institute before commencing the exportation of yam to Europe and the US.<br /><br />Ukpabi said, “The problem associated with yam export to Europe is due to improper consultation. We are the research institute in charge of roots and tubers in Nigeria, but unfortunately, we were not consulted before the yam exportation exercise started.<br /><br />“The viruses that affect yam are numerous; so, you need to know the varieties of yam that you are exporting. I am trying to see the Minister of Agriculture to know what actually happened to the exported yams and why they got spoilt before their transit to Europe.”<br /><br />Nigeria produces not less than 60 per cent of the world’s yam production, according to the Federal Government, but it does not rank among the world’s highest exporters of the crop.<br /><br />The government, it was learnt, had directed some of its agencies to ensure that yams exported were properly checked and certified.<br /><br />Some of the agencies involved in the whole process are the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, Nigerian Ports Authority, Nigeria Customs Service, Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria, Standards Organisation of Nigeria, Nigerian Export Promotion Council, among others.<br /><br /><b>By: Okechukwu Nnodim and Bayo Akinloye</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Nigeria has three universities of Agriculture namely the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta (FUNNAB), Federal University of Agriculture, Makurdi and the Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, Umudike,Abia state.<br /><br />He listed the areas of departures as including departure from the provisions of the original statute establishing the AUs, departure from the original academic and programme structure and departure from best global practices.<br /><br />“Until the recent policy change, the institutional structure and functions of the UAs show a marked departure from both the norm in implementing the concept of UAs in other parts of the world. “I urge FUNNAB and the two other UAs to take advantage of their reintegration into the Ministry of Agriculture and get enlisted as our reliable allies in the agricultural sector,’’ he said.<br /><br />Ogbeh promised that the Ministry of Agriculture would build a dam and blocks of hostels in the school. He also promised to provide mini- tractors at 60 per cent discount as well as develop the institutions’ seed faculty for production of more improved seedlings among other areas of support.

    "title": "Killer Grains: FG, IITA Introduce Nonchemical Storage Bags",
    "content": "<br />The incidence of cases of food poisoning due to chemical storage of grains in Nigeria would now become a thing of the past as farmers in the country have been introduced to sophisticated nonchemical crops storage bags to preserve grains.<br /><br />Grain Reserves The technology known as Purdue Improved Crop Storage, PICS, bags has put an end to occurrence of wrong application of chemicals in storage of grains, resulting in food poising like “killer beans” and other chemical related preserving method, which have caused a lot of death and harms to many people in the country.<br /><br />The Purdue Improved Crop Storage, PICS, system was developed by Larry L. Murdock, professor of entomology in the Purdue College of agriculture, and scientists in Cameroon. The research was funded by a USAID program and supported by Purdue’s International Programs in Agriculture. The crop storage system was licensed to Kano-based Lela Agro Industries Nigeria Ltd.<br /><br />In order to make good use of the technology, the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, IITA, has organised training for farmers, traders and other stakeholders in Abuja. Speaking during the training, the Coordinator of Purdue Improved Crop Storage, PICS, project, Abdoulaye Tahirou, said effective use of technology like the PICS bags can allow farmers to earn more profits as they are able to sell when the market is favourable.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dYxPp5Y3uyo/WeieqnfS7kI/AAAAAAAAAf0/3c3_8sogJsYQ_TSthndBAIYgz5ezNilDQCLcBGAs/s1600/Grain%2BReserves.jpeg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"269\" data-original-width=\"412\" height=\"208\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-dYxPp5Y3uyo/WeieqnfS7kI/AAAAAAAAAf0/3c3_8sogJsYQ_TSthndBAIYgz5ezNilDQCLcBGAs/s320/Grain%2BReserves.jpeg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Tahirou added the PICS bags technology is a simple and easy to use approach that uses special airtight plastic bags to preserve grains in storage. He explained “The essence of this training we are doing today is a gathering of agro dealers who across the country are selling the bags but we want to empower them.<br /><br />When people come to buy the PICS bags from them, they are not just selling them the bags but they are able to provide them with the right information on how to use these bags. “These bags have a specific way of using them that would make them effective. You have to use them in such a situation such that air does not penetrate inside that is the technique that allows the bag to work.<br /><br />“We also empower those agro dealers in terms of teaching them some simple marketing tools that they can use in order for them to sell more of these bags.” On the specific crops the bag should be used to store, he said, “These bags originally when they were designed, they were designed for storage of cowpeas. When we started promoting them for cowpeas, we noticed that farmers were using them for other crops and they keep asking us, can it work for maize, can it work for sorghum, we didn’t have the answer.<br /><br />“So we designed a second project where a research was conducted and we were able to validate through research that yes the same bags that were used to in protecting cowpeas can be used to protect maize, rice, sorghum, millet, most of the grain crops that are not full of oil can be used in these bags. In addition, a lot dry vegetables are also be stored inside these bags.<br /><br />He recalled that, “The use of those chemicals especially bad chemicals that are intended for protecting crops in the field they use it for storage. And when people use chemicals to store, they don’t wait for the period that they should wait before eating it and that is what causes all those problems of killer beans and so on and so forth.<br /><br />“And that is what are pushing for so that people should know that it is not magic; all you need to do is make sure you put your crops in that container and don’t allow nay air to come in and without air the insect cannot survive and if they cannot survive they will not eat your crop, it is as simple as that.<br /><br />He said response from farmers using these bags is quite encouraging. In almost all the villages where we have been or where we have done the demonstration, the first thing is surprise, it is really possible to store without using any chemicals and we tell them yes it is possible but all we want from you is that you try it and when people try it, then the response is very enthusiastic. On affordability, Tahirou said the bag is very affordable, it is cost effective.<br /><br />The bags are being sold in Nigeria now at different prices but I think factory rate is 450 and I don’t know what they are selling at the retail points. But I can tell you that farmers are really finding it affordable because they are buying it.<br /><br />“I won’t say it is cheap but it is affordable because it is effective because if you look at the benefits it gives compared to the cost you have to pay. Some farmers find it so valuable that they don’t even sell their crops with it, they just use it to store and when they are ready to sell, they put it in another container and sell it.”<br /><br /><b>By Chris Ochayi</b><br /><b>Vangaurd News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Activities at the Agricultural Research Council of Nigeria (ARCN) were grounded in the last few weeks over what the staff called “deliberate violation of the council Act” regarding staff promotion.<br /><br />&nbsp;The staff, in a protest in Abuja at the ARCN premises, also accused the management of the council of allegedly using armed policemen to intimidate&nbsp; them for calling the management’s attention to respect the council’s laws as contained in the Act that set it up.<br /><br />&nbsp;The problem started a few weeks ago when a committee set up to screen staff due for promotion disqualified many on the ground that they needed a PhD to rise to director cadre - an issue that has been in contention since 2014.<br /><br />&nbsp;In a letter dated 10th October, 2017 to the Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh, signed by their chairman, Ademola Oloyede, secretary, Ubi Ikpi, as well as other union officials, the staff, under the Joint Action Committee, the various unions made two requests to the minister.<br /><br />&nbsp;The requests are: “That the Ag Executive Secretary, Professor A. A. Voh and Dr. Celestine Ikuenobe who headed the screening committee, should as a matter of urgency, vacate the council for reasons of abuse of office, gross incompetence, completion of approved one year secondment (from 1st April, 2016 to 31st March, 2017) and being above the retirement age of 60 years or 35 years of service.”<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tU3kMR_Bkxk/WdcyS4XPp_I/AAAAAAAAAQY/KQ8TdWlO4yYuqv7tFoC7bnPxLw5VH5-HQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/ARCN.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"127\" data-original-width=\"154\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-tU3kMR_Bkxk/WdcyS4XPp_I/AAAAAAAAAQY/KQ8TdWlO4yYuqv7tFoC7bnPxLw5VH5-HQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/ARCN.jpg\" /></a></div><br />&nbsp;They also want the duo “to be compelled by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, being the mother and supervisory ministry of ARCN, to write and sign an undertaking guaranteeing the safety of the lives of the staff in ARCN following harassment of staff by armed policemen.”<br /><br />&nbsp;The staff also cited a directive dated 29th January, 2015 from the Office of the Head of Service of the Federation, which was copied to the Executive Secretary of ARCN stating that: “The ARCN is a regulatory and policy coordinating body for agricultural research institutes owed by the Federal Government. Its role is similar to those of the National Universities Commission which is the regulatory body for universities, but whose staff retire at 35 years of service or 60 years of age. The rationale provided by the council is insufficient to establish and classify the council as a research organization.”<br /><br />&nbsp;In his response, the Ag Executive Secretary of the Council, Professor A. A. Voh, said everything the council was doing was in consonance with the act establishing the council and also the condition of service of the council’s staff, research institutes and colleges.<br /><br />&nbsp;Professor Voh stressed that he had discussed the issue with the permanent secretary regarding the staff grievances, adding that the actions were in accordance with the council’s Act.&nbsp;<br /><br /><b>By Vincent A.

I don’t know where in Nigeria anyone can take cashew and sleep but you can take the beef and milk and sleep. So we see that unless it is unbundled as done in other countries livestock will continue to be at the back ground”<br /><br />The Herder further advised that existing grazing reserves should be developed with available veterinary services.<br /><br />Also speaking, HOMEF Director, Nnimmoh Bassey said “Conflicts between herders and farmers are not inevitable. We must agree that this is a recent phenomenon both in Nigeria and other African countries”<br /><br />He advised that as such ” We have to interrogate the causative factors propelling this unwholesome development, note the economic roots and the role of careless relationship with the earth ,use of symbiotic relationship on animals husbandary and farming where animals help fertilise the soils of fallow land”.<br /><br />The Environmentalist wondered if climate change escalates,if the movement of herders migration would be the only way to mitigate the impacts and also if the Greater Green Wall project would reverse migration and conflicts”<br /><br />Participants in a communique at the end of the interactions recommended that the word herdsmen/pastoralist be used instead of Fulani herdsmen to avoid unnecessary stereotyping, re-orientation of pastoralist/ farmers, note that when making policies climate change impacts differently on different categories of people.<br /><br />Other recommendations advocated more collaboration between Nigeria and developed nations in the fight against climate change, that government carries out livestock development policy reviews to align with regional and international practices as well as avoid the politisation and sensitization of herdsmen/ farmers conflicts amongst others.<br /><br /><b>By Ruth Tene Natsa,</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Harvests Crash Produce Prices in Katsina",
    "content": "<br />Paddy rice being loded into trucks at Bakori grains market, Katsina State<br /><br />The price of farm produce has significantly reduced as farmers are recording bumper harvests in Katsina State.<br /><br />Several factors, such as complementary and composite demands of the produce have seen prices dwindle in recent weeks.<br /><br />Sorghum for example was expensive last season with its price at between N16,000 and N18,000 by this time but this year, Daily Trust gathered that it costs as low as N9,000 due to the bumper harvest of maize and millet that are its direct substitutes.<br /><br />Alhaji Adamu Nalado, an agri-entrepreneur in Funtua market told Daily Trust that sorghum was expensive by this time last year because merchants from the far north and Niger Republic mopped the produce to their markets but this year they were only interested in buying maize that was in abundance and at lower price.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JYE-xzbQuRc/Wehoi6Sg7ZI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/8yLHSwxRwDgHZ2vnl24px9eO7DrwKqSVwCLcBGAs/s1600/Bag%2Bof%2BMaize.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JYE-xzbQuRc/Wehoi6Sg7ZI/AAAAAAAAAfQ/8yLHSwxRwDgHZ2vnl24px9eO7DrwKqSVwCLcBGAs/s320/Bag%2Bof%2BMaize.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“Besides companies that buy sorghum in large quantities, merchants from far north and Niger Republic also buy the produce in bulk but this year because they had a bumper harvest of millet, their demand for sorghum is low and instead they prefer to buy maize,” Alhaji Nalado said.<br /><br />He added that the price of sorghum may improve before the harvest of the new one but certainly it would not be as expensive as last year especially as companies were looking forward to buying the new one within the next two months.<br /><br /><b>&nbsp;MAIZE</b><br />Farmers in Katsina State have experienced bumper harvest of maize as they cultivated it massively. Before this season, it was gathered, a 100kg bag costs up to N16,500, but now, after the harvest of the new produce, its goes for N8,500.<br /><br />A maize farmer and merchant, Alhaji Muhammad Sani Dandume, said the development was as a result of mass cultivation of the crop and the importation of the produce by some industrialists on the other hand.<br /><br />“We all anticipated a significant reduction of maize price going by the mass production of the crop this year, but we are discouraged by the importation of the produce by some industrialists on the eve of our harvesting period. This, if continued, will hamper the actualization of the Federal Government’s policy on self-sufficiency in maize production,” said Alhaji Dandume.<br /><br />He further said that about two weeks ago, the price of the produce was as low as N6,000 but with only few buyers in sight.<br /><br /><b>RICE</b><br />Like maize, Katsina State has seen large-scale cultivation of rice this year: abundant fertilizer and sufficient rainfall have resulted in a bumper harvest of the produce.<br /><br />This reporter observed that the price of locally milled rice has come down from N800 to N600 per measure while paddy rice was sold at N8,500 instead of N13,000 per bag.<br /><br />A local rice miller and seller at Bakori grains market, Malam Farouk Abdullahi, said but for buyers from Sokoto, Kebbi and Kano states, the price of local rice would have been much lower considering its mass production in the state.<br /><br />“Kebbi State that engaged mostly in irrigated rice farming is now part of our customers and with the proliferation of modern milling machines, many farmers are coming from Kano to buy the produce; this has retained the price of milled rice at N24,000 per 100Kg bag as against N32,000 some months back,” he said.<br /><br />Farouk added that there is good prospect for rice farming in Katsina State just like Kebbi, though the farmers have no access to reliable dams for irrigation.<br /><br /><b>MILLET</b><br /><br />Millet is a produce that has no much industrial value but widely consumed, particularly in the northern part of the country. In Katsina State, it was gathered, millet was mostly cultivated in the northern part of the state and this year the farmers have experienced a bumper harvest of the produce.<br /><br />Malam Aminu Ibrahim, a millet merchant, said in the last fasting period, they sold 100Kg of millet at N18,000-N20,000.<br /><br />“Katsina State has recorded a bumper harvest of millet too and that has affected the demand for sorghum in the northern part of the state, especially as they use the two produce interchangeably. The price of 100Kg bag now costs N11,500 here as against N20,000 some months back,” said Ibrahim.<br /><br /><b>By Idris Mahmud,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The sorghums were in the budding process when the rain ceased<br /><br />Sorghum farmers in Jigawa State may not experience bumper harvest as earlier envisaged following the early stoppage of rainfall with the drawn-out affecting most farms across the state.<br /><br />In most of the farms, the crops were greatly shocked due to the dry spell which is suggesting that the crops may not produce well for harvest as the rains ceased at the time the crops were budding.<br /><br />Rainfall ceased in most parts of the state in the last few weeks, raising fears that majority of the farmers that cultivated sorghum may not have a good harvest unless there are some weather changes within a short time.<br /><br />Most of the farmers, who spoke to Daily Trust, expressed fear that quite a number of them would record zero harvest this year because their crops were about to start budding when the drawn-out sets in.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MwXbeo9jh90/Wehn62Wz3DI/AAAAAAAAAfI/ksaBDHkOb2Uy1xNDlLb_v8UPD4mqcAiNwCLcBGAs/s1600/Sorghum.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MwXbeo9jh90/Wehn62Wz3DI/AAAAAAAAAfI/ksaBDHkOb2Uy1xNDlLb_v8UPD4mqcAiNwCLcBGAs/s320/Sorghum.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Some, however, are hopeful as their crops had gone far in the process of maturity before the stoppage of the rain.<br /><br />Our reporter also reports that propensity of the dry spell threat varied from one part of the state to the other.<br /><br />The reporter cited Gumel and its environs, which has sandy soil, as experiencing lesser threat compared to Birnin Kudu area which has an opposite soil texture.<br /><br />Experts believe that this type of condition may help in keeping the crop growing because sandy soil is usually cool in the night, hence it provides a certain level of moisture to crops.<br /><br />Also, the situation remains the same with those that cultivated the crop around rivers as moisture from the rivers radiating in the surrounding area will be enough to keep the crops to maturity.<br /><br />One of the experts believes that farmers around Hadejia and Birnin Kudu are among those at risk of having poor harvest as their farms are on high ground where the soil does not store moisture.<br /><br />Yusufa, who is a sorghum farmer from Hadejia, told Daily Trust that it was now over 10 days that the area has been without rainfall, adding that even the last rain that fell was as a result of special prayers organised for divine intervention.<br /><br />He said at present, most of the crops were visibility weak, indicating that there was shortage of water, adding that even if it rained, some farms would not recover because of the already severe impact of the dry spell.<br /><br />“Most sorghum farms have been written off because of the water shortage as a result of early stoppage of rains this year. You can see how the plants have wilted away. Look at the leaves; they are becoming very limp. But this is not even the problem; the trouble is the crops have not started budding, and in such situation, the crops can hardly survive the devastation,” he said.<br /><br />Haladu Yusuf, who is an official of the All Farmers Association of Nigerian (AFAN) in Birnin Kudu Local Government Area, said the dry spell had dealt a blow to sorghum farms in the area, adding that the area was the part of the state where the crop was grown in large quantity.<br /><br />&nbsp;“However, one cannot lose hope until the end of the season. Who knows, the tables could turn now; if it rains there is probability for some to survive the threat,” he said.<br /><br />Another farmer in Maigatari area told this reporter that their sorghum farms were also under threat due to water shortage, but that they were a bit optimistic of having a reasonable harvest even if it did not rain.<br /><br />He said this is because their soil, which by nature became cool at night, was enough to keep the crops alive.<br /><br />He pointed out that majority of the farmers around Maigatari/Gumel largely produced sorghum and that in situations like this, they hardly panicked considering the nature of their soil, adding that the sandy soil assisted by releasing moisture to the crops at night and in the morning.<br /><br />Usman Adamu Izge, a professor of agriculture with specialty in Genetic and Crop Breeding at Federal University Dutse (FUD), blamed the farmers for using traditional seeds that lasted for about five months to mature instead of the improved varieties, adding that with an improved variety that only last 120 days, a farmer had mitigated the threat for early rain stoppage.<br /><br />He explained that most farmers hardly accepted innovations, hence many of them used seeds inherited from their forefathers, which did not only give low yield, but also took time to grow, and that if a situation like that occurred, it would be a serious threat.<br /><br />“My own sorghum farm is not under threat whatsoever because I used an improved variety that does not exceed 120 days to mature.<br /><br />“We will continue to enlighten them by cultivating small farms beside theirs and allow them to compare them in terms of yield and period of maturity,” he assured.<br /><br /><b>By Aliyu M.

    "content": "<br />Mr Yandev Amaabai, the Managing Director, Wan Nyikwagh Farms Nigeria Limited, has appealed to the Federal Government to provide the necessary support to private yam exporters in order to cut cost and prevent time wastage.<br /><br />An entrepreneur, Mr Yandev Amaabai, has advised the Federal Government to fast-track the transportation of yam tubers to the United States of America and United Kingdom before their shelf life expiration.<br /><br />Amaabai made the appeal in an interview with a list in Abuja.<br /><br />He said that the Federal Government’s policy on yam exportation to the US and UK was a good initiative, adding that Nigeria was the largest producer of the product in Africa.<br /><br />He noted that for the policy to achieve its objectives, there are some challenges that needed to be put in place by the government to ease the stress of exporting yams to other countries to earn foreign exchange.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZuqOyr-3fM/Wehd6FoxvdI/AAAAAAAAAes/yKUs9rwcWqQgTOiW_biLM6q2FJvLkZk3wCLcBGAs/s1600/Yam.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-PZuqOyr-3fM/Wehd6FoxvdI/AAAAAAAAAes/yKUs9rwcWqQgTOiW_biLM6q2FJvLkZk3wCLcBGAs/s320/Yam.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“I moved my yams from Benue to Lagos on 25 and 26 of June. The flag-off for the yams exportation was on the 29th by the Minister of Agriculture, Chief Audu Ogbeh.<br /><br />“When we got to Lagos, I discovered that we needed certain containers to export the yams. I discovered such containers were not available so we were given a space at the port to packed the yams.<br /><br />“After the flag-off, I was able to get the required container. So my yams were loaded on July 7 and left Nigeria on July 9 to the US. The yams did not get to the US until Sept 1.<br /><br />“After the flag-off, we were left on our own without any form of direction or assistance by the government and this did not go down well with us.<br /><br />“Because movement within the ports took us more than 2 to 3 days. To move a container from Tin Can port to Apapa port just a close distance was hectic for us,” he said.<br /><br />He further stated the Federal Government agency is saddled with the responsibility to ensure proper packaging and handling of this product for export due to the lack the exact requirements.<br /><br />“From my experience, the government agency that was supposed to supervise how we were packaging the yams did not know the exact thing they were supposed to do.<br /><br />“We were asked to cut the bottom of the yams and put wax but when we got to the US, we discovered that that was not necessary. The moment you cut the bottom of the yam, it makes it rotten quicker.<br /><br />“So some of the yams when we arrived the US were actually not too good again but most were good and we sold all out,” he noted.<br /><br />Reacting to the recent report of poor quality of consignment of yams exported from Nigeria to the US, the Managing Director debunk the story, stating that the report was politically motivated to frustrate government’s effort.<br /><br />“We did not have any challenge with the America government. My yams were the first to arrive. It was cleared and delivered to the warehouse just three days after shipping in.<br /><br />“The second day, we moved them to quarantine office where they did fumigation.<br /><br />“Then we packed our yams to the warehouse. So wherever this story is coming from that America government says that yams exported from Nigeria are not good, I don’t know about that.<br /><br />“Even on the shelves in the US, you can still see some Ghanaian yams rotten. I have pictures as evidence to show in case of any doubt.<br /><br />“There is no way these yams could have been 100 percent okay because of the time wasted to ship them to the US.<br /><br />“By all standards, yams from Nigeria were far better in terms of quality and taste. Right now, we are out of stock. The yams we took there were all bought, ” he said.<br /><br />Amaabai, however, appealed to the Federal Government to reach out to these shipping lines and ensure quick delivering of such perishable product in good time.<br /><br />“Government should reach out to the shipping lines. Let us get shipping lines that can do this thing in a shorter period to avoid a lot of time being wasted.<br /><br />“My yams went through 12 ports before it finally got to the US. If we can get ships that are going the direct route, that will have been better and the cost will also be reduced.<br /><br />“So far, it was a success story. I believe this is a learning process. I have learned a lot. Next time, I should be able to cut the cost at least half of what I inquired from this last experience.”<br /><br />It will be recalled that the Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS) an agency that has the responsibility to ensure the quality of yams for export provided farmers with guidelines to meet international standards.<br /><br />Dr Vincent Isegbe, Coordinating Director, NAQS, spelled out the conditions to include: uniform size of the product, it should not have growth on the head, it will be cut and waxed with a candle to prevent infection among others.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Ogbe: Food Exports’ll Boost Forex Earnings",
    "content": "<br />The Federal Government is looking to boost agricultural exports to earn more hard currency, and aims to cut imports of rice and wheat which together cost it almost $4 billion a year, Agriculture Minister Audu Ogbeh has said.<br /><br />Nigeria emerged from recession in the second quarter as oil revenues rose, but growth was sluggish. The government has touted agriculture as a way to wean the country off its oil dependence, improving access to finance and introducing policies to try to encourage private investment.<br /><br />In a sign of progress, Ogbe said Africa’s most populous nation would be self-sufficient in unmilled rice this year, though milling capacity was constraining output which he expected would be increased by April next year.<br /><br />He said Nigeria needed 12 million tons of unmilled rice to achieve eight million tonnes of milled rice to meet local demand, and the country’s production was approaching 20 million tonnes of unmilled rice this year.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/atKa4P5KNKsoFWXBRnKfEq9zXmgEkMuQwCEwYBhgL/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAdE/atKa4P5KNKsoFWXBRnKfEq9zXmgEkMuQwCEwYBhgL/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Unmilled rice production was 7.85 million tons in 2016 and was just 4.54 million in 2010, government figures show.<br /><br />“We redesigned the agricultural programme … clearly saying that we are looking for an alternative to oil and gas.<br /><br />“The simple thing in diversifying the economy (is) to increase local production of staples and substitute for imports – top of which is rice and wheat,” Ogbe said in an interview in Abuja, adding the rice policy would save Nigeria $1.6 billion yearly.<br /><br />Ogbe said a similar policy had worked with sorghum and now the country was able to meet local demand, especially for the beer industry, substituting for barley imports.<br /><br />On wheat, he said the plan was to cut imports by 2019 as current output of 300,000 tonnes grows thanks to better seed.<br /><br />Ogbe said the government was aware that crude oil demand would probably decline over the next 10 years and had made a call to boost agriculture, which contributes around 40 per cent to its gross output and is growing.<br /><br />Africa’s biggest economy earned $12.9 billion in non-oil revenues in 2013. Ogbe expects agriculture will generate around $40 billion in five years time, nearly the same as the country earns from crude exports, as it looks to boost sales of cocoa, cashew, livestock, coconut oil, sesame seed, cassava.<br /><br /><b>Source: The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />The Etsu Nupe, Alhaji Yahaya Abubakar and Chairman Coordinating Committee, National Council of Traditional Rulers of Nigeria, has said that the current policy direction of government towards boosting the agriculture sector would require partnerships with international firms with knowledge of modern agriculture technology to help rural farmers acquire new skills.<br /><br />The royal father, who was the chairman at the a two- day Nigerian Agri-Food Investment Forum, organized by “ Youths Off The Street” YOTSI, in Lagos, said concerted efforts should be made in the area of attracting foreign investors as the sector is showing greater signs of improvement.<br /><br />He said, no doubt that president Muhammadu Buhari has demonstrated genuine commitment in stimulating appetite of investors to move into the sector and through policy initiative the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN has made various interventions to support farmers.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9SMutj0nEYQ/Wecuw_2t3OI/AAAAAAAAAc8/15d_D2hfjPY2wywxAmPuzDKgIAcU3vSmgCLcBGAs/s1600/ETSU-NUPE.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"555\" data-original-width=\"559\" height=\"317\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9SMutj0nEYQ/Wecuw_2t3OI/AAAAAAAAAc8/15d_D2hfjPY2wywxAmPuzDKgIAcU3vSmgCLcBGAs/s320/ETSU-NUPE.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Etsu Nupe declared that the country has no excuse to fail as Nigeria is blessed with arable land, with committed people willing to galvanize and promote the sector. He therefore solicited Global partnerships which according to him would be facilitated through incentives to promote ideas that will turn around the sector.<br /><br />Abubakar informed the gathering that government has demonstrated genuine desire to promote agriculture business through its diversification policy. “We have had various interventions in the past like Operation Feed The Nation, Green Revolution but I see commitment by President Muhammadu Buhari administration to move away from rhetorics because today we are witnessing a significant turn-around in the agriculture sector. We are also seeing deliberate interventions by the Central Bank of Nigeria, supporting farmers and the private sector is keying into several programs initiated by government.<br /><br />It is therefore a commendable move to draw Youths into this and adequately engage them in meaningful economic activities as this will in the long run produce results by curbing crimes and provide food security for the growing population” the royal father declared.<br /><br />In his remarks John Bray the US Consular General in Nigeria, said his country is bringing private sector solutions to grow Nigeria’s agriculture business. Bray who was represented by Brent Omdahl, commercial counselor to the US Mission to Nigeria, said US is deeply engaging and galvanizing partnerships and that presently some companies from the US are involved in providing technology models to support small scale farmers to improve their yield.<br /><br /><b>By:&nbsp; Chika Izuora</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Senate yesterday urged government at all levels to adopt Anchor Borrowers Programme of the Central Bank of Nigeria, CBN in order to address the problem of food security and poverty eradication in the country.<br /><br />It, however, mandated its Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development to investigate the circumstances surrounding the delay in extending this laudable intervention programme to other states and the FCT.<br /><br />Similarly, the upper legislative chamber directed the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, Presidential Committee on Rice Production and other agencies concerned to sustain the momentum in states where the programme is already launched.<br /><br />These were sequel to a motion, titled, “The Anchor Borrowers Programme and its benefits to farmers”, sponsored by Senator Mohammed Sha’aba Lafiagi (APC Kwara North).<br /><br />Senator Lafiagi said the senate was aware that “the CBN in line with its developmental function established the Anchor Borrowers Programme which is intended to create a linkage between anchor companies involved in processing of key agricultural commodities and small holders farmers.”<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YFUn_GungJ4/WecuM9kIxSI/AAAAAAAAAc4/0yFGK0KfUpU7tyg4u5D1osLpllTnp1nSgCLcBGAs/s1600/senate-NIGERIA-1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"400\" data-original-width=\"750\" height=\"170\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-YFUn_GungJ4/WecuM9kIxSI/AAAAAAAAAc4/0yFGK0KfUpU7tyg4u5D1osLpllTnp1nSgCLcBGAs/s320/senate-NIGERIA-1.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>He expressed worry about the unpredictable price of crude oil and its resultant effect on the revenue profile of the country, and therefore stressed the need to boost agricultural production and non-oil exports in order to diversify the economy from solely depending on oil revenue.<br /><br />The lawmaker further said, “There is need to create economic linkage between small holder farmers and reputable large processors with a view to increasing agricultural output.”<br /><br />Similarly, he said it was important to assist rural smallholder farmers to grow from subsistence to commercial production in order to reduce agricultural commodity importation and conserve external reserve and also increase capital utilization of agricultural firms.<br /><br />According to him, “The thrust of the programme is the provision of farm inputs in kind and cash (for farm labour) to small holder farmers to boost production of these selected commodities, stabilize inputs to agro-processors and create a new generation of farmers/entrepreneurs thereby assuring employment.”<br /><br />Senator Lafiagi added that “loans granted to the smallholder farmers under this programme are to be repaid with harvested produce delivered to the anchor and must cover the loan principal and interest which must not be above 9 per cent per annum.”<br /><br />He noted that the CBN and the Presidential Committee on Rice Production launched the programme in some states like Kebbi, Jigawa, Ebonyi, Sokoto, Imo and Cross River which has led to massive production and exportation of rice in 2017.<br /><br />The former Kwara State governor also stated that “the programme has led to massive cultivation, self- sufficiency in food production and job creation for the unemployed youth through farming in the selected states where the programme is being practiced.”<br /><br />In his contribution, the Senate Leader, Senator Ahmad Lawan maintained that agriculture remains the surest way to fight poverty and ensure peace and security in the country.<br /><br />He, therefore, advised that the Anchor Borrowers Programme should be targeted at smallholder farmers across the country, saying that “if this is done, there will be employment to better the lives of various families.”<br /><br />Senator Lawan added that the programme should be left for farmers who have no access to loans and funds to embark on commercial farming so that its impact could be felt in the country.<br /><br />Also contributing, Senator Barau Jibril (APC Kano North) said apart from food security, the problem of inadequate raw materials for industries in the country would become a thing of the past if the programme is extended to every state.<br /><br />The Deputy Senate President, Ike Ekweremadu, who presided over the plenary, in his remarks said agriculture could still become the mainstay of the nation’s economy if given top priority.<br /><br /><b>By Ahuraka Isah and Solomon Ayado&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "World Food Day: Nigeria Far From Achieving Food Security",
    "content": "<br />As Nigeria joins the global world to celebrate the World Food Day (WFD), indications arising from various stakeholders have shown that the nation is far from achieving food security, RUTH TENE NATSA writes.<br /><br />A free publication, light of the world, defines food security as a situation that exists when all people, at all times, have physical, social and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life”.<br /><br />Unfortunately this cannot be said to be the case in Nigeria which still suffers nutritious food depravity despite the huge existing opportunities to become a food secured nation. LEADERSHIP recalls that the United Nations Children’s Fund, (UNICEF), in July 2016 claimed over 2.5 million Nigerian children were suffering from Severe Acute Malnutrition.<br />Similarly the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the UN had reported that some 7.1 million people are now severely food insecure across four countries including Cameroon, Chad, Niger and Nigeria.<br /><br />Director of FAO’s Emergency and Rehabilitation Division, Dominique Burgeon, said in the worst-affected areas, famine continues to loom and millions will remain trapped in cycles of severe hunger if we don’t enable farmers to start cropping now. “Our collective efforts cannot be limited to merely avoiding massive famine – they need to allow people to return to a dignified life. And supporting agriculture is the key to both” he said.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAc0/tnI4_ztajasxqN3MgBNHLtK3fj4mVeGaACLcBGAs/s1600/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"268\" data-original-width=\"386\" height=\"222\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FL-lpPcsKgw/Wectu1K39kI/AAAAAAAAAc0/tnI4_ztajasxqN3MgBNHLtK3fj4mVeGaACLcBGAs/s320/Audu-Ogbeh.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />LEADERSHIP findings reveal that these levels of food insecurity arise from the high cost of food commodities across the nation, lack of infrastructures, high cost of production, poor/lack of storage facilities, lack of markets, limited/non-existent extension officers across the states, poor security of lives occasioned by insurgency in the North East, and the constant clashes and invasions between farmers/herds men, poor /insufficient fertilizer (this is despite the Presidential Fertilizer Initiative) introduced by the present administration to supply fertilizer at N5,500 to farmers.<br /><br />Other issues include the continual importation of agric commodities which denies local farmers access to markets, natural disasters including flooding and the unmitigated effects of climate change, aging population of farmers and use of crude methods of production among other issues.<br /><br />LEADERSHIP findings have uncovered that the PFI fertilizer is limited and farmers in many states cannot access the product, while some sharp hands are able to hoard the fertilizers and sell at higher prices. It should be recalled that the federal government marked the bags with toll free numbers to enable Nigerians report irregularities, but findings have also revealed that the number never gets through<br /><br />Speaking at the 2017 and 10th anniversary of the National Agricultural Show and World Food Day, which began in Keffi Nassarawa state, on Monday 16 to end Thursday 20,2017 with the theme: Agriculture for Sustainable Economic Diversification and Growth ,United Nations Food and Agricultural Organisation (UN/FAO) Country Representative, Mr. Suffyan Koroma said the “WFD is a chance to showcase development to achieving SDGS Goal 2.<br /><br />It will help to achieving zero hunger by 2030 by promoting worldwide awareness and action for those who suffer hunger and for the need to ensure food security and nutritious diet for the world.” He noted that “This year’s WFD with the theme Change the future of migration: Invest in Agriculture and Rural Development’’ is highly relevant as we have 65 million people worldwide who were forcefully displaced from their homes by conflicts, violence and prosecution in 2015.”<br /><br />The country representative noted that the increasing number of conflicts their complexity ,their protective nature rural development and food insecurity, weak employment and income generating opportunities, inequality, limited access to social protection, the accelerated environmental degradation and increasing impact of climate change would result in a growing number of people forcibly displaced or migrating under distress than ever.”<br /><br />He urged that on this WFD 2017, “We shall all reinforce our beliefs that the right to food is a basic human right and achieving the 17 SDGs cannot happen without ending hunger and without sustainable and resilient climate compatible agriculture and food systems that delivers for the people and the planet.”<br /><br />Koroma said “We need to stand together in solidarity against acts of discrimination and called on leaders to make migrations safe, orderly and regular.” Also speaking, Chairman, Senate Committee on Agriculture and Chairman Board of Trustees (BOT) Nigerian Agricultural Foundation of Nigeria(NAFN), Senator Abdullahi Adamu lamented the lack of price control affecting agricultural commodities.<br /><br />He said “what Nigerian farmers are expecting is that their commodities should have price, they should know when they produce, what price they are going to get, either by tonne by volume or whatever to be set by the government which he said is lacking at this point in time”<br /><br />The Lawmaker added that since the abolishing of the marketing boards which government very ably used for the marketing of its produce, there has been no alternative to it, adding that there is a huge vacuum which is why the sector has been having the kind of problems in regards to pricing, warehousing and marketing of products. “It is our hope that in order to give our efforts the necessary push, government would need to address those issues” he said.<br /><br />Also speaking, the National President, All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Kabiru Ibrahim said “it is instructive to note that Nigeria is in the process of implementing a green alternative agenda (APP) which espouses the need to change the mindset Nigerians to envision Nigeria as capable of making economic growth through Agriculture in the main as against relying on oil.<br /><br />“This is both challenging and interesting to do. It is challenging because we are being asked to cast our mind to the 50s and the late 60s when Nigeria’s economy was sustained by agriculture and Interesting because our current population calls for innovation” he said.<br />The farmers president said “for the nation to be able to have food sufficiency, food security and overall economic growth sustainably “Nigeria must deploy agricultural technology by embracing Biotechnology: encourage the use of genetic engineering to evolve seeds which will resist drought, resist insects, striga infestation, increase yield and enhance wellness of the consumer.”<br /><br />He said “the nation must further adopt good agricultural practice, Seek foreign exchange through processing, create the enabling environment to bring about additional cultivable land and give the farmer a slot on the actual drivers’ seat of the Green Alternative Policy: involve the farmer in the nitty-gritty as he knows where shoe pinches etc.”<br /><br />The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Ogbeh said the Federal Government has restated the commitment of government to tackle food insecurity and ensure Nigeria becomes a food Sovereign nation. According to Ogbeh, the federal government had introduced an array of agricultural programmes to ensure food security and the long term economic growth of the nation.<br /><br />“Accordingly, the federal government of Nigeria has committed itself on tackling food security in the nation and also to respond to the current challenges of food insecurity.” He also said “over the years, Nigeria agricultural sector has been focusing on the conventional paradigm of harnessing resources to sustain food security and that presently, the ministry is committed to making the sector a pivot for economic stabilization in diversifying, generating employment and creating wealth in the country.<br /><br />The World Food Day is an international event established during the 20th session of the food and agriculture organization (FAO) of the United Nations conference in 1979 and is observed on 16th October annually by all member nations to promote worldwide effective action to end hunger, malnutrition, reduce poverty, improve food security and social economic conditions, especially of the rural populations.<br /><br />The Minister assured that over the years the ministry had imbibed the culture of promoting best practices in agricultural development through improving access of farmers to inputs and credit facilities in rural areas, employment generation, building a national extension system and driving agriculture through commodity value chain approach .<br /><br />Whatever the challenges there is no doubt that Nigeria can become a food secured Nation with the vast agricultural lands it has, the over 70 million population of farm workers and the many policies government always brings, what remains is for government to create the enabling environment by ensuring access to inputs and loans, agric machinery and implementation of all policies to support Nigerian farmers.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

That invariably made some of the yams to become rotten, leading to their outright rejection when they landed at their final export destination,” a source told THISDAY last night.<br /><br />The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, also recently alluded to the blunder by the exporter, saying the container was left in Nigeria for two months before it left in very hot environment.<br /><br />“Government does not export yam. We flagged it off, but someone left it here for two months in a hot environment. What I find extremely nauseating is that somebody seems to be celebrating the fact that Nigerian yams were rejected as if it was a victory for him as an individual. It happens all the time that commodities get bad because of poor handling. You don’t take things that are perishable,, keep them in bad conditions, ship them out and embarrass Nigeria,” Ogbeh lamented.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the federal government has facilitated the establishment of 12 large scale rice processing mills under the China EXIM Bank $325.67 million facility.<br /><br />The mills, according to Ogbeh, were part of the targeted 40 in number, 30,000 metric tonnes per annum integrated large scale mills.<br /><br />He also said government had also aided the completion of mills that are capable of producing 2.5 tonnes and 1.8 tonnes of paddy rice in Badeggi, Niger State at the cost of $1.8million under the Korean- African Food and Agriculture Corporation Initiative (KAFACI) Programme.<br /><br />The project was revived after it was abandoned by the President Shehu Shagari administration in the early 1980s.<br />He also said government has commenced the restructuring of the Bank of Agriculture (BOA) in order to ease credit facilities for Nigerian farmers and stimulate interest of people in farming as a source of livelihood.<br /><br /><b>By: Olawale Ajimotokan and Cynthia Offor&nbsp;</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Rise, Fall of Donkey Business in Sokoto",
    "content": "Sokoto is noted for booming donkey business with an international border market at Ilela, a depot in the state capital as well as village markets in some of the local government areas.<br /><br />Every Sunday, which is the market day for Ilela, the ‘Kara’ (livestock section) of the international market witnesses booming donkey business activities.<br /><br />A visit by of Daily Trust on Sunday to the weekly market, it was lively with several donkeys various sizes for sale and a good number of customers from the eastern and western parts of the country jostling to buy the best for their money.<br /><br />The market was a beehive of activities with middle men trying to outdo one another, errand boys who did minor jobs for a token, such as looking after donkeys sold to stop them from straying, while others engaged in marking the animals already sold for easy identification. The owners of such marked donkeys paid a token N20 for the service.<br /><br />Transporters position their trailers at strategic locations waiting for buyers who come from different parts of the country.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Trust on Sunday, the Vice Chairman of Sokoto State Donkey and Horses Association, Ilela Market, Alhaji Mu’azu Gwadabawa, said they get over 1000 donkeys on Sundays&nbsp; from Abala, Gidan Iddar, Tawa, Agadez in Niger Republic, Mali as well as from within Sokoto and Kebbi&nbsp; states.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HMmN-pN1DI8/WeYHyGi05ZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/F2UfPX76NxIjGYwcpNsXa1LU92RK08zqwCLcBGAs/s1600/Donkey%2BMarket.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HMmN-pN1DI8/WeYHyGi05ZI/AAAAAAAAAcQ/F2UfPX76NxIjGYwcpNsXa1LU92RK08zqwCLcBGAs/s320/Donkey%2BMarket.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Alhaji Mu’azu, however, lamented that “The donkey business is no longer what it was a year ago due to the fall of the naira in the market which has affected our business. The Chinese buyers who patronize our donkeys very well insist on the same rate at which they used to buy our donkeys even though the high cost of the dollar has forced us to buy at higher prices. This has made our people to sell donkeys to them at a loss.<br /><br />“As our people continued to incur heavy losses from sales to Chinese customers, they gradually had to bow out of the business,” he said.<br /><br />The vice chairman lamented that over 90 percent of donkey businessmen are no longer in the business. “They have gone bankrupt,” he lamented.<br /><br /><br />“The business has now reduced to only 15-20 percent participation with mostly lgbo and Yoruba traders coming to buy the animals.<br /><br />He said last Sunday, only 15 – 20 Canter trucks or trailers were loaded with the&nbsp; donkeys unlike before when large number of trailers leave the market on weekly basis to various destinations.<br /><br />“The price of s donkey is now N30,000 – N50,000 and the smaller ones cost anything below N20,000,” he disclosed.<br /><br />The donkey dealers also complained of numerous roadblocks on the roads which he alleged were additional expenses for their customers. ‘’They are made to settle those who mount such roadblocks before being allowed to pass. They collect as much as N3,000 from our people for a trailer load of donkeys before allowing them to pass.”<br /><br />Daily Trust on Sunday was at another popular donkey market in the state, located in Bodinga Local Government Area where the donkey business takes place on Tuesdays and Fridays.<br /><br />Friday being the bigger market day witnesses large supply of donkeys and customers who throng the section of the ‘Kara’ livestock market allocated to the donkey sales.<br /><br />The chairman, Donkey Sellers Association, Bodinga Market,&nbsp; Murtala Mai Taki, also lamented that “business in the donkey market has dropped since last year when Chinese companies which patronized donkeys for their hide and skin stopped coming to buy them from us.”<br /><br />“We don’t get much from the business now since prices of donkeys are low. Last year, a well fed donkey costs as much as N90,000 – N100,000 but now one can get the best donkey at N30,000 – N50,000,” he said.<br /><br />Mai Taki said they get supply of donkeys from villages in the locality and other areas of the state.<br /><br />He recalled that Bodinga donkey business started earlier than that of Sokoto town, adding that it was after the business became successful at Bodinga that people in Sokoto town&nbsp; started it.<br /><br />“Our market is older than that of Sokoto that is why they still refer their bigger customers to Bodinga for large purchases, customers from Sokoto get as much as five Canter truck loads of donkeys on Friday market days,” he disclosed.<br /><br />He said customers cut across those who need donkeys for domestic and agricultural activities and merchants who purchased them in good number to the eastern and some other parts of Nigeria for consumption.<br /><br />“Those who purchase them for domestic and farm work use them for conveying manure to farms and farm produce back home during harvest. They also use them to fetch water for their families, collect clay or sand in the river, and haul heavy commodities to markets for sale,” he explained.<br /><br />The chairman said Bodinga branch of the association has over 70 members, and the last time they got government’s support was during the last administration in the state.<br /><br />Murtala&nbsp; said they require another plot of land for the business as they need to move the market from its present site which he described as very inconvenient. He&nbsp; &nbsp;also solicited for soft loan from Sokoto State government to boost their business.<br /><br />He complained of what he described as unnecessary levies they pay at some checkpoints on market days.<br /><br />Murtala said illela border market has the highest number of donkeys for sale. “We travel there to buy for our customers here in Bodinga,” he disclosed.<br /><br />An individual trader can bring 30-40 donkeys, he added.<br /><br />A donkey merchant from Gusau In Zamfara State, Musa Bala Gusau, who has 15 years in donkey supply business, said he patronizes Bodinga market weekly.<br /><br />“I can afford two Canter truck loads of donkeys at N2 million every week which was N4 million – N 4.5 million last year,” he revealed.<br /><br />Musa said: ‘’Though donkey is still available but the market is no longer favourable since Chinese people declined patronizing donkey for their skin.”<br /><br />It was same story at the donkey depot in the Sokoto State.&nbsp; “Market was far better last year because of patronage from some Chinese firms who deal in donkey hide and skin and they paid good money for a donkey,” said a donkey dealer, Aminu Attahiru, who has spent 20 years in the business.<br /><br />He added: “We sold a donkey for N80,000-N100,000 last year but this year you can get the best and biggest donkey at N50,000 - almost half of the price of last year. One can even get a N15,000-N20,000 donkey in the market today.”<br /><br />He recalled that last year, trailer loads of donkeys worth millions&nbsp; &nbsp;of naira were frequently transported from the depot in Sokoto and major markets of Ilela and Tangaza Local Government Areas of the state.<br /><br />On the drop in number of donkeys at the Sokoto depot, the dealer said the business had shifted base to village markets across the state.<br /><br />“Our agents go to village markets because donkey owners no longer transport their animals to Sokoto for sale, they prefer to take them to village markets where it is more conducive, fetch better money and save them cost of transportation,” he explained.<br /><br />&nbsp;He added: “Our agents who attend village markets to purchase donkeys for customers from the southern and eastern parts of Nigeria also get them in good number at such markets and they transport them to Sokoto depot here for the onward journey to their respective destinations.”<br /><br />According to the dealer, the agents mostly go to Gwadabawa, Illela, Gada, Sokoto, Achida, Tangaza&nbsp; and Tambuwal local government areas where the villagers bring out their donkeys in large numbers for sale.<br /><br />Daily Trust learnt that some agents and middlemen go to villages on the Nigeria\\Niger Republic border to buy donkeys.<br /><br />It was also discovered that in the rural areas, especially among peasant farmers, motorcycles have taken over some of the work done with donkeys.<br /><br />“Nowadays, some farmers prefer to convey manure to farms, fetch water, get animal feeds, and convey farm produce to their homes during harvesting season on motorcycles. They also use it to collect sand and clay which they use to build houses,” a donkey dealer Nasiru Aliyu stated.<br /><br />He, however, added that “Donkeys carry more load than motorcycles only that motorcycle is faster and saves cost of regular feeding and donkey maintenance.”<br /><br />Alhaji Aminu said the donkey and horse dealers’ associations need support from government to boost their trade.<br /><br />“During Wamakko’s administration, we were given a donation of N1 million but since then we have not received any support from government,” he stated.<br /><br />&nbsp;He solicited for support, such as loan, for the members of the association to support their business, which he lamented “is now in a trying moment.”<br /><br />&nbsp;A donkey merchant, Abubakar Sabo Wajake, said “donkeys are still available just that the business is taking place more at village markets.”<br /><br />He gave the different breed of donkeys available in the state to include Auraki, Goho, Duna, Jangora, Fari Asasan and Akaza among others.<br /><br />At the donkey market, accessories which go with the animal are also sold.<br /><br />They include takunkumi (mouth cover) dabaibayi (a rope which restricts straying by donkeys), gindi (a rope for tying a donkey to a place), tagazai (a twine used to drag the donkey to the desired destination) and kahu which serves as cushion or seat for a donkey rider.<br /><br />Mohammed Ibrahim, a donkey accessories merchant, who has spent 10 years in the business, decried low patronage due to dwindling donkey business at Sokoto depot.<br /><br />&nbsp;“I used to make N10,000 on Friday market days as many people came to transact donkey business then, but now I hardly make N2,000,” he stated.<br /><br />Ibrahim also attributed the poor sales at the Sokoto depot to the shift of donkey business to village markets<br /><br /><b>By Rakiya A.

    "title": "How FUTA’s New Tomato Variety will Boost Farmers’ Income",
    "content": "A new variant of tomatoes named Eva F1 has been introduced into Nigeria courtesy of a collaborative effort between the School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology (SAAT) and the Teaching and Research Farm (TRF) of the Federal University of Technology, Akure, Ondo State.<br /><br />The Eva F1 tomato is a variety five to seven times bigger in size than the commonly available ones in the Nigerian market and it is capable of producing paste more than four times the others.<br /><br />The Dean, School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology, Professor Taiwo Amos, and Farm Manager, Mr Olajide Adedayo, said the seedling was imported from Israel and carefully nurtured in FUTA’s Green House under controlled temperature.<br /><br />The Head of Protocol and Media of the school, Mr Adegbenro Adebanjo told Daily Trust on Sunday that it all began with the immediate past dean of SAAT, Professor Shadrack Akindele, who saw the product on a working visit to Israel, linked up with Dizengoft Nigeria, and the organisation sold the idea to the university management.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9lQI3qhu-AY/WeYGjSq-RgI/AAAAAAAAAcI/pLORds3qT94w4XBVSUT614P-qGuT6FmsACLcBGAs/s1600/Tomato.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-9lQI3qhu-AY/WeYGjSq-RgI/AAAAAAAAAcI/pLORds3qT94w4XBVSUT614P-qGuT6FmsACLcBGAs/s320/Tomato.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The management bought the idea and gave approval for its cultivation and production through the green house modern farming technique.<br /><br />The Eva F1 tomato, Adedayo said, has the rare quality of imperishability over a period of two weeks from date of harvest.<br /><br />Taking Daily Trust&nbsp; on Sunday correspondent round the green house, Adedayo explained that the tomato was an indeterminate hybrid variety with an extended shelf life. According to him, it is a flier generation where two parents were crossed.<br /><br />He told Daily Trust that the green house or screen house is made in such a situation where it can prevent all environmental factors. It is well netted and rain proof, adding that they water the plants according to their needs, because it has a range of water requirement. The green house, he said, can last for 10 years.<br /><br />&nbsp;He described the development as the actualisation of part of the mandate and determination of the university to put science to work for the society.<br /><br />According to him, the Teaching and Research Farm under the watch of the School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology has gone into the farming and production of Tomato Eva F1 variety in the green house using modern farming technique.<br /><br />&nbsp;He said high crop yield is achieved under a small area of land as a unit of the green house covers 192m2 (8m x 24m)”.<br /><br />Stating the advantage of its potentials, Adedayo said “with this technology, the tomato crop will be grown and produce round the season. The Eva F1 tomatoes are organically produced and an indeterminate hybrid variety with an extended shelf life, good resistance to cracking with flower setting at high temperatures.”<br /><br />On the gestation period, he said, “the first harvest of the fruits started after three months of planting and we hope to continue the harvest for the next six months.”<br /><br />Departments in the School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology such as Agricultural Extension and Communication (AEC) and Food Science Technology (FST) are already involved in a joint research effort through sampling the fruit for analysis and to determine the level of its nutritional content for finished product such as tomato paste, ketchup among others.<br /><br />So, how the common man on the street will benefit from this, Adedayo said it is an investment worth trying. “You need only small land, small area for big production. It could also be grown round the year and a good source of family income and employment opportunity especially for the youths.”<br /><br />He urged the government to come in and assist unemployed youths that are interested in agricultural production, put them into clusters and make available to them basic facilities and they are set to go. “It will take them off the streets,” he said, adding that it is a modern farming system devoid of the rigours of farming. It is more like an exercise.<br /><br />“It can be exported because of the long shelf life. About 1.8 kilo of the product is just about eight or nine tomatoes while the locally produced fruits take over 77 tomatoes to make same 1.8 kilos.”<br /><br />&nbsp;He stressed that while it is an educational tool, for teaching and&nbsp; learning for&nbsp; them in FUTA, it is also to encourage enterprising students, add to their source of income and also train farmers and other trainees sent to the school periodically to acquire knowledge.<br /><br />The Vice-Chancellor, Professor Fuwape, described the successful cultivation and production of the Eva F1 tomatoes as another proof of FUTA’s robust contributions to the development of the country through pursuit of excellence in its area of core mandate.<br /><br />He called on investors and interested agencies to partner with the university in order to engender massive cultivation of the new variety and stimulate its contributions to the economy.<br /><br />Daily Trust on Sunday&nbsp; visited the green house and the production was quite impressive.<br /><br /><b>By Bola Ojuola,&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Increased harvest, increased income and improved standard of living are our concern,’’ Arc Ibrahim said.<br /><br />The Federal Government has said it would take responsibility if the GM cowpea is harmful to health or environment.<br /><br />The Director General of NBMA, Dr Rufus Ebegba, said the government would take responsibility for any failure resulting from GM products.<br /><br />He said there was no going back on the adoption of GMOs by the government as it is the only way the country could ensure food security.<br /><br />‘’Be rest assured, GM foods are safe.

    "content": "The National Directorate of Employment (NDE) is to commence farm project of palm tree plantation in Nigeria. The palm tree revolution will involve date palm and oil palm. This was disclosed recently in Abuja by the Director-General of the NDE, Dr. Nasiru Mohammed Ladan Argungu, while exchanging views with journalists and German expatriates on new strategies for employment creation in Abuja.<br /><br />Date is a sweet sticky brown fruit that grows on date palms commonly found in North Africa and Western Asia. Oil palm on the other hand is the most widely planted and protected tree as well as the most economic and useful tree within the traditional farming system of South Eastern and Western Nigeria in the 60s to the early 80s.<br /><br />Argungu said that the giant stride of the government in rice farming which has resulted into a fall of rice import net from 1.2 million metric tonnes in 2014 to only 58 tons in 2016 is a pointer to the fact that agriculture as the mainstay of humanity has the potential to lead the desperately needed economic rebound from the year long doldrums.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-80TPgIORxaU/WeX4uvbjndI/AAAAAAAAAbk/PkIAPEv7G1Mch3zzjdkQuwgnG3MRRG8cwCLcBGAs/s1600/NDE%2BChairman.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-80TPgIORxaU/WeX4uvbjndI/AAAAAAAAAbk/PkIAPEv7G1Mch3zzjdkQuwgnG3MRRG8cwCLcBGAs/s320/NDE%2BChairman.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Agriculture, he said, is tested and reliable machinery for effective economic diversification, as prioritised in the policy thrust of President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration.<br /><br />He said the wealth and economic prosperity of Nigeria in the 60s could glaringly be linked to the groundnut pyramids, Oil palms and Cocoa Trees.<br /><br />According to Argungu, NDE will create a new scheme under the Rural Employment Promotion (REP) Programme called ‘’Green Cash for Nigerian Youth’’ under which the Directorate will focus essentially on Economic Trees.<br /><br />He said efforts are on top gear to secure at least one million high yield seedlings of both Date and Oil palms to kick start the project in the northern part of the country. He said the selected youths in the South-South and South-West will concentrate on Oil Palm plantation.<br /><br />For the reason of Date Palm Plantation initiative, the Directorate, under its present leadership, has expanded its collaboration beyond the shore of Nigeria.<br /><br />To ensure success, NDE is to collaborate with the Centre for Scientific and Technical Research on Arid Regions (CSTRAR) in Biskra, Algeria.<br /><br />The collaboration is being facilitated by the Federal Government of Nigeria through her embassy in Algiers, Algeria. In a letter signed by Minister Counselor and Head of Chancery, M.S. Nuhu, the NDE contingent is expected to visit Algiers to consummate the Collaboration and visit some poverty alleviation agencies of the country in order to exchange ideas on employment generation and poverty alleviation.<br /><br />Also in its urgent push to kick – start the Palm Plantation Project, NDE has finalised agreement with the Research Institute in Edo state for monthly release of 50,000 seedlings to fast track and maintain the continuity of the project.<br /><br />‘’All These efforts, according to the DG, will further encourage jobless youths especially university graduates to migrate and advance their status from motor cycle riders to gainful farming’’<br /><br />Throwing more light on the readiness of the Directorate for the project, Dr. Ladan said that NDE has already secured vast land from some local government areas to enable the engagement of youths in modern farming.<br /><br />‘’We have about 35 hectares of land in Sabuwa, Katsina state, another of such in Akunnu in Ondo state and we are asking for more from the local government council areas’’.<br /><br /><b>By: Soji-Eze Fagbemi&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

On October 16, people around the world come to together to declare their commitment to eradicate hunger in our life time. It was first established in 1979, and today it has been observed in almost every country by millions of people,” he said.<br /><br />He observed that in Bauchi State, although 85 per cent of the population are agrarian, the budget allocation to agriculture over the years has not been more than seven per cent.<br /><br />“This contributes to making agriculture unattractive especially to the youths,” he observed “Again, women constitutes over 60 per cent of the agricultural work force, adding that with the intervention of LINE project, about 73 per cent of women are now involved in agriculture. “Through LINE Project, 3, 165 farmers have been given farm inputs worth N79 million and the project hopes to provide inputs to an additional 7, 000 households.<br /><br />The beneficiaries have gone through trainings on modern farm technologies as well as improved nutritional options,” Saayinzat said. In his remark, the Permanent Secretary, Bauchi State ministry of Agriculture Rural Development, Dr. Bala Musa Lushi, commended the Oxfam LINE Project being implemented in the state and expressed optimism that it will improve farming activities in the state and address food security.<br /><br /><b>By: Paul Orude</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The Lagos State Government on Monday disclosed that it had acquired 32 metric tonnes per hour rice mill, which would help create no fewer than 200,000 jobs and ensure sustainable supply of wholesome rice to the state at affordable price.<br /><br />The state government, equally, disclosed that it had already partnered Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ekiti and Ondo States to ensure that adequate rice paddy “is supplied to the 32 metric tonnes per hour rice mill and boost rice production in the country.”<br /><br />This was contained in an address by the state governor, Mr. Akinwunmi Ambode, delivered at the 2017 World Food Day yesterday, revealing that 1,140 residents would benefit from various farming enterprises designed to boost their productive capacities in line with the state’s food security objective.<br /><br />Ambode, who was represented by the Commissioner for Wealth Creation &amp; Employment, Mr. Babatunde Durosinmi-Etti, said the rice mill would lead the creation of no fewer than 200,000 jobs in the state at the time full operation begins.<br />He explained that the rice mill would ensure sustainable supply of wholesome rice at affordable price to the populace in Lagos, noting that the acquisition of the rice mill would help to reduce rice importation into the market.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yxoCLGhDgOc/WeCfGJc1iUI/AAAAAAAAAWc/hr5xmJDrf0c5N93_2--EHTPBlaXYB_TzwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B3.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"183\" data-original-width=\"275\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-yxoCLGhDgOc/WeCfGJc1iUI/AAAAAAAAAWc/hr5xmJDrf0c5N93_2--EHTPBlaXYB_TzwCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/picture%2B3.jpg\" /></a></div><br />To guarantee the adequate supply of harvest rice to the rice mill, the governor noted that the state government had already partnered five South-west states – Ogun, Oyo, Osun, Ekiti and Ondo States in the area of rice production.<br />He briefly reflected on how the discovery of oil in the late 1960s triggered the neglect of agriculture, which he said, was the mainstay of the Nigerian economy, especially in the first republic.<br /><br />&nbsp;Under the First Republic, the governor noted that food security was not an issue because the country was producing enough not only to feed its citizens and still export to other countries.<br />He explained that it had become imperative “to conserve foreign exchange by reviving the agricultural sector through policies and programmes that will encourage more people to go into farming and increase food production..”<br /><br />He noted that the state government had provided basic facilities evenly distributed across the state, especially in rural communities despite the fact that most farming activities are based in the rural and semi urban areas.<br /><br />He said: “Our objective is to make our communities liveable and centres of economic activities. This strategy, we believe, will reverse the trend of rural to urban migration and also make farming more attractive especially to young people.<br /><br />Aside improving the quality of lives in rural areas where farming activities take place, he noted that the state government “is providing road infrastructure to facilitate the transportation of harvested produce to markets in the cities. This will address the issue of post-harvest wastage which will in turn translate to more income for farmers.”<br />Also speaking, the Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr. Oluwatoyin Surau explained the various farming enterprises that had been created to realise the state’s food security objectives and guarantee food sufficiency.<br /><br />He said the enterprises include egg marketers, piggery, butchery poultry production, vegetable production, perishable produce trading, sheep and goat production, aquaculture, fish feed input, artisanal fisheries and fish processing.<br /><br />He said the Ambode administration “has made food security one of its cardinal programmes which serve as tool to poverty alleviation and sustainable economic growth through agricultural development to underscore fiscal responsibility.”<br /><br /><b>By: Gboyega Akinsanmi</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The failure of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Ministry of Finance Incorporation (MOFI) to pay their equity contributions amounting to N18.22 billion to the Bank of Agriculture (BoA) has constituted a stumbling block to the latter’s discharge of its mandate of employment generation and poverty alleviation, THISDAY has learnt.<br /><br />It was learnt that while MOFI has outstanding equity contributions of N2.24 billion to the agriculture bank, the CBN is indebted to the tune of N15.97 billion.<br /><br />The funding constraint was said to have weakened the bank’s loan disbursement capability to farmers&nbsp; from N7.2 billion in 2010 to N3.2billion in 2011 and later increased to N3.7 billion and N5.6 billion in 2012 and 2013 respectively.<br /><br />This came as the Chairman of the House of Representatives Committee on Agric Production and Services, Hon. Tahir Monguno (APC, Borno) told THISDAY it would soon sponsor a legislation which will seek to allow BoA to manage all agricultural intervention funds, rather than keep them in the ministry of finance or CBN.<br /><br />He said: “We are saying we want to diversify our economy away from agriculture and to diversify the economy is not only about input but there’s a need for us to give our farmers access to credit facilities at single digit interest rate; and not from the conventional banks that nowadays charge double digit interest rate.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6LSq6JS63HM/Wd_L5llpXPI/AAAAAAAAATg/TNaTY9j1i7gW-H-tpcqq5mAr2rKCE283ACPcBGAYYCw/s1600/Bank-of-Agriculture.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"222\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"177\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6LSq6JS63HM/Wd_L5llpXPI/AAAAAAAAATg/TNaTY9j1i7gW-H-tpcqq5mAr2rKCE283ACPcBGAYYCw/s320/Bank-of-Agriculture.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“So, for us to achieve that, there’s the need for us to recapitalise the Bank of Agriculture (BoA) and call on the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and the Ministry of Finance Incorporated to pay up their equity share so that the bank would be in a position to really achieve their mandate.”<br /><br />He expressed concern that two years after government unveiled plans to recapitalise the bank, there had been little progress towards achieving the objective.<br />However, the BoA which is expected to be recapitalised soon is currently trying to rejig its personnel, and IT among others.<br /><br />Managing Director/Chief Executive, Bank of Agriculture, Mr.&nbsp; Kabir Mohammed Adamu had in a submission to the committee on the need to fully subscribe to the share capital of the bank for optimal contribution to the country’s ailing economy, a copy which was obtained by THISDAY lamented that despite presidential approval, MOFI had only injected N27.75 billion over 14 years while CBN had only contributed N4.02billion, bringing total equity contributions to N31.77 billion.<br /><br />BoA is wholly owned by the federal government through the MOFI and CBN at the ratio of 60:40 respectively.<br />After the merger in 2000, the president had approved the recapitalisation of the bank to the tune of N50 billion to be injected in four equal instalments of N12.5billion each, payable in four yearsfrom 2001 by the shareholders.<br /><br />Adamu said the bank’s operations had been challenging largely because of paucity of funds, high overhead with running costs with low level of income caused by lack of loanable funds,&nbsp; low recovery drive and general economic downturn among others.<br />He put the bank’s current overhead and running costs at N2.52 billion against an income of N1.39 billion.<br />The bank is further constrained by high non- performing loans which are yet to be recovered.<br /><br /><b>By: James Emejo</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Food security is a complex condition requiring a holistic approach to all forms of malnutrition, the productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, resilience of food production systems and the sustainable use of biodiversity and genetic resources.<br /><br />After steadily declining for over a decade, global hunger appears to be on the rise, affecting 11 percent of the global population.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FjSHhCy6a3I/WdzQfE_K8XI/AAAAAAAAASE/5P88s9zeXGIPpT4xcjZP7sDUfqfFuDtZQCPcBGAYYCw/s1600/food-baskets.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"248\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-FjSHhCy6a3I/WdzQfE_K8XI/AAAAAAAAASE/5P88s9zeXGIPpT4xcjZP7sDUfqfFuDtZQCPcBGAYYCw/s320/food-baskets.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>In addition to an increase in the proportion of the world’s population that suffers from chronic hunger (prevalence of undernourishment), the number of undernourished people on the planet has also increased to 815 million, up from 777 million in 2015.<br /><br />This sobering news comes in a year in which famine struck in parts of South Sudan for several months in 2017 and food insecurity situations at risk of turning into famines were identified in other conflict-affected countries, namely Nigeria, Somalia and Yemen.<br /><br />The food security situation visibly worsened in parts of sub-Saharan Africa, South Eastern and Western Asia. This was most notable in situations of conflict, in particular where the food security impacts of conflict were compounded by droughts of floods, linked in part to El Niño phenomenon and climate-related shocks.<br /><br />Over the past 10 years, the number of violent conflicts around the world has increased significantly, in particular in countries already facing food insecurity, hitting rural communities the hardest and having a negative impact on food production and availability.<br /><br />The situation has also deteriorated in some peaceful settings, particularly those affected by economic slowdowns. A number of countries heavily dependent on commodity exports have experienced dramatically reduced export and fiscal revenues in recent years. Thus food availability has been affected through reduced import capacity while access to food has deteriorated in part due to reduced fiscal potential to protect poor households against rising domestic food prices.<br /><br />The worrisome trend in undernourishment is, however, not yet reflected in nutritional outcomes. Evidence on various forms of malnutrition points to continuous decreases in the prevalence of stunting among children, as reflected in global and regional averages.<br /><br />Nevertheless, stunting still affects almost one in four children under the age of five years, increasing their risk of impaired cognitive ability, weakened performance at school, and dying from infections.<br /><br />Overweight among children under five is becoming more of a problem in most regions, while adult obesity continues to rise in all regions. Multiple forms of malnutrition therefore coexist, with countries experiencing simultaneously high rates of child undernutrition and adult obesity.<br /><br />Undernutrition, overweight and their associated non-communicable diseases now coexist in many regions, countries and even households. Six nutrition indicators – three that form part of the SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals) monitoring framework, and three that refer to global nutrition targets agreed by the World Health Assembly, are described below to better understand the multiple burden of malnutrition, which affects all regions in the world.<br /><br />As difficult as it might be to make sense of a situation in which food security is under threat globally but child undernutrition (stunting) is falling and adult obesity is rising, there are a number of possible explanations.<br /><br />Food security is only one determinant of nutritional outcomes, especially for children. Other factors include: women’s educational level; resources allocated to national policies and programmes for maternal, infant and young child nutrition; access to clean water, basic sanitation and quality health services; lifestyle; food environment; and culture.<br /><br />Particularly in high- and upper-middle income countries, food insecurity and obesity often co-exist – even in the same household. When resources for food become scarce, and people’s means to access nutritious food diminish, they often rely on less-healthy, more energy-dense food choices that can lead to overweight and obesity.<br /><br />Additionally, food insecurity and poor nutrition during pregnancy and childhood are associated with metabolic adaptations that increase the risk of obesity and associated non-communicable chronic diseases in adulthood.<br /><br />Last but not least, changes in dietary patterns and food systems have led to increasing consumption of highly processed foods in many countries. Readily available and accessible, these products are often high in fat, sugar and salt and signal a shift away from traditional diets, further explaining the coexistence of multiple forms of malnutrition within the same communities and even households.<br /><br />The major threats to food supply in Nigeria are floods and rampaging herdsmen.<br /><br />Recently, Benue State governor, Samuel Ortom, in the midst of the incessant rainfall in the state, raised the alarm of impending food scarcity in the country, going by the devastation caused by the flood on farmlands in 21 out of the 23 local government areas of the state. Ortom, who is one of the biggest farmers&nbsp; in the state, lost over 5,000 hectares of rice and yam farms to the flood&nbsp; at his country home in Guma Local Government Area. Aside hundreds of homes in some communities that were submerged by the flood, the aftermath of the downpour has shown that farmers in the state are the worst hit. About 10,000 farmers had their crops washed away, translating to almost 300,000 hectares of farm lands that were completely submerged and damaged.<br /><br />The state chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria, (AFAN), Mr Aondoana Hembe, revealed that rice, maize, yam and soya beans farmers, who are mostly into mechanised farming, recorded high level of loss.<br /><br />According to him, “The devastating effect is unimaginable because it affected 21 local government areas of the state,” he affirmed, expatiating further that “over 90,000 farmers were affected, as their crops were completely buried in the water.<br /><br />On April 25, Nimbo, an agrarian and border community in Enugu State, was attacked by herdsmen, leaving dozens of farmers killed and many others seriously injured. It was learnt that farmers in the community are yet to recover from the trauma.<br /><br />Dr. Otaha Jacob from the University of Jos, Plateau State, believes that the solution to the problem is to ensure peace between the herdsmen and farmers.<br /><br />“Other ways of feeding cows have to be devised. There should be ranches. Statistics have shown that in Nigeria, only 141 grazing reserves were gazetted with less than 20 equipped with resources for pastoralists,” he said.<br /><br />Other agriculture experts believe that if the proposed National Grazing Route and Reserve Commission is established to engender acquisition and management of lands across Nigeria’s 36 states to provide pastures for cattle, farmers will be able to produce what the country can eat and export.<br /><br /><b>By: Nurudeen Alimi</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "ALGON, 16 Foreign Partners to Create 5.9m Jobs from New Agriculture Scheme",
    "content": "As part of steps to boost agriculture in the country, the Association of Local Government of Nigeria(ALGON) and 16 foreign partners and institutes are expected to float a new scheme which will create 5,959, 800 jobs nationwide.<br /><br />The scheme will lead to the generation of 7,700 jobs in each of the 774 local government areas in the country.<br /><br />But the new initiative called Comprehensive Agricultural Plans for Local Government Areas (CLAP) will begin with a seminar on October 26 and 27.<br /><br />A statement last night said ALGON has initiated the process of C-LAP at grassroots level to prepare a Comprehensive Local Agriculture Plan (C-LAP) through participatory process involving various organizations and stakeholders.<br /><br />The statement said: “The project is expected to generate direct employment of 2700 in nursery production, pack houses and integrated model farms, mega food parks processing units and indirect employment of 5000 persons per LGA is as follows: Managerial and scientific manpower (100 persons); Skilled manpower in Mega Food Park (600 persons); Unskilled manpower (2000 persons) and Indirect employment like transport, marketing etc. (5000 persons).<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IMFku1IGj6c/WeSHcZiLGuI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/iZI6c4sNbmA9kC9mKgynwEGTGa6vA6bsQCLcBGAs/s1600/ALGON.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"450\" data-original-width=\"450\" height=\"320\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-IMFku1IGj6c/WeSHcZiLGuI/AAAAAAAAAZ0/iZI6c4sNbmA9kC9mKgynwEGTGa6vA6bsQCLcBGAs/s320/ALGON.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />The heavyweight international partners of ALGON are Global AgriSystem Pvt Ltd; Progressive Research Organization for Welfare (PROW); Ananya Seeds (P) Ltd; International Tractors Limited; Horticulture Produce Management Institute, HPMI (India); Population, Women &amp; Environment Development Organization(Nepal); International Rice Research Institute(Philippines); Ananya Seeds (P) Ltd.; Top Greenhouses Limited; and International Tractors Limited.<br /><br />Others are Michigan State University; G.B.

Swaminathan Research Foundation.<br /><br />The statement explained why ALGON decided to collaborate with the 16 foreign partners.<br /><br />It added:&nbsp; “Nigeria is an agrarian society, with agriculture contributing about 24 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP). About 70 percent of the population live in rural areas and depend on agriculture for livelihood.<br /><br />“Nigeria is presently facing several challenges in Agriculture sector.&nbsp; These problems can be attributed to natural and human cause, affecting overall economic development and growth.<br /><br />“This has consequently undermined socio-economic growth and thus constitutes a threat to the Federal Government of Nigeria’s “Vision 2020”. Recent assessments of the situation in the country confirm that the scale of the problem rise above what communities, Local Governments, States and Federal Government can address without help from development partners.<br /><br />Consequently, The Association of Local Governments of Nigeria (ALGON) is adopting a bottom-up approach through a Comprehensive Plan for Development of Agriculture (C-LAP) at “Local Government Level” in 774 LGAs of Nigeria towards the improvement of the agricultural sector.<br /><br />“Thus C-LAP is an integrated and participatory action plan for the development of LGAs in agriculture and allied sectors. CLAP will add value to Nigeria’s agricultural raw materials and integrate Nigeria into world agricultural markets.<br /><br />“ALGON has initiated the process of C-LAP at grassroots level to prepare a Comprehensive Local Agriculture Plan (C-LAP) through participatory process involving various organizations and stakeholders.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: The Nation News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "CBN Intervention Fund Paves Way For Food Security",
    "content": "As Nigeria joins other nations to mark World Food Day today (October 16), with the theme, ‘Change the future of migration. Invest in food security and rural development,’ it is instructive to spotlight the role by Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) in actualising the country’s commitment towards food sufficiency, rural development and stemming rural-urban migration. The apex bank is also determined to see Agriculture positioned as Nigeria’s alternative foreign exchange (forex) earner to oil and gas; while meeting the growing raw material needs of local industries.<br /><br />The Bank has played this remarkable role through various Intervention Fund programmes targeted at indigenous small and medium enterprises (SMEs), including those in the agriculture value chain. The intervention policy was introduced in 1977 to create jobs, expand the real sector and boost the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP). It has remarkably addressed potential and identified constraints experienced by Nigeria’s 17 million SMEs in accessing funds meant for their development. The intervention scheme has gulped about N3 trillion during the 40 years it has existed.<br /><br />The micro-schemes created under the CBN intervention policy are all sector-specific. They include the Agricultural Credit Guarantee Scheme (ACGS); Nigeria Incentive-Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending (NIRSAL); Commercial Agriculture Credit Scheme (CACS); the N220 billion Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSME) Fund; and the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R3IST2W1u0c/WeSC4RTJ4LI/AAAAAAAAAZo/h3fMmWCIxXAedfr_P07fb8nNH5ulV328QCLcBGAs/s1600/CBN6-300x202-1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"202\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-R3IST2W1u0c/WeSC4RTJ4LI/AAAAAAAAAZo/h3fMmWCIxXAedfr_P07fb8nNH5ulV328QCLcBGAs/s1600/CBN6-300x202-1.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Others are the Small Medium Enterprise Credit Guarantee Scheme (SMECGS); the added N2-billion interest rebate funds under the revolving Interest Draw Back (IDB) of the ACGS Fund and strict supervision of operations of microfinance banks. Additionally, the CBN directed (and is monitoring) the establishment of agricultural desks at all deposit money banks (DMBs). Since February 20, 2017, the apex bank has engaged in aggressive funding of the sub-sector through its multi-window forex intervention regime that has gulped $10 billion as at date – focusing on Wholesale, Investment &amp; Exports, SMEs, Invisibles and Bureau the De Change (BDCs) segments, among othes.<br /><br />In line with its transparency trajectory, the Bank publishes several reports of its activities under the intervention initiative. According to its monthly Economic Report for May 2017 (which is the latest), a total of N424.6 million was guaranteed to 4,029 farmers under the ACGS in May 2017. Sub-sectoral analysis showed that the food crops received the largest share of N226.1 million (53.3 per cent) guaranteed to 2,699 beneficiaries, livestock got N62.2 million (14.7 per cent) guaranteed to 282 beneficiaries, while cash crops sub-sector received N44.4 million (10.5 per cent) guaranteed to 221 beneficiaries. The mixed crops received N42.2 million (9.9 per cent) guaranteed to 597 beneficiaries while N38.3 million (9.0 per cent) was guaranteed to 137 beneficiaries, in the fisheries subsector, ‘others’ had N11.2 million (2.6 per cent) guaranteed to 93 beneficiaries.<br /><br />With this unyielding commitment on the part of the CBN, it is obvious that any development injurious to the intervention fund schemes would promptly raise genuine concerns; otherwise, it would portray the Federal Government as blowing penny whistle in its diversification bid. This explains the worries in certain quarters over reports of poor quality supply of Nigeria’s export produce in recent times. Analysts maintain that the development is a sad commentary on government effort, through the CBN and other agencies, to make Agriculture play its role in growing the nation’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP).<br /><br />For instance, some consignments of yams exported by Nigeria to the United States of America (USA) recently, were rejected by that country for being of “poor quality”. The development, expectedly, infuriated Chief Audi Ogbe, Nigeria’s Minister of Agriculture &amp; Rural Development. Ogbe had, about three months earlier, engaged in a near-Champaign pop to celebrate what seemed a historic landmark in Nigeria’s diversification effort towards up-scaling agriculture as a viable forex earner. Nigeria had in July exported 72 metric tonnes of yams to the United States, United Kingdom (UK), and China which attracted wide media attention at the time.<br /><br />Elated Ogbe had disclosed that Nigeria targeted a yearly revenue boost of eight billion Dollars from yam export alone, a move that would create massive jobs for Nigerians and restore agriculture as Nigeria’s economic mainstay. “We are returning agriculture to its pre-oil boom era when the sector was the nation’s economic mainstay,” Ogbe was quoted as telling members of the Technical Committee on Nigeria Yam Export Programme in Abuja when the group launched its programme in June. Ogbe had also predicted that the programme would enable the country to earn forex from agriculture products to de-emphasis dependence on oil and gas sector.<br /><br />Expectedly, the rejection of (unspecified volume of) Nigeria’s yam export by authorities of the United States, was a source of grave concern to Ogbe. The Hon. Minister had vowed to see to it that those responsible for the act of “national embarrassment” did not go unpunished. “Some consignments of yams were exported from Nigeria to the United States and according to reports we have today, they were found to be of poor quality. We will be investigating both the company that exported it and our quarantine department to check and find out why such a consignment left here”, Ogbe was quoted as saying in a note of anger last week.<br /><br />But that was not the first time Nigeria’s agricultural exports would be rejected. The European Union in 2016 rejected a total of 24 food products exported from Nigeria for failing to meet stipulated standards. According to Abubakar Jimoh, then Director-General of National Agency for Food &amp; Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), the affected products included palm oil, dried fish, beans, groundnuts, sesame and melon seeds. Each of these items had their specific quality and standard deficits. For instance, Nigeria’s groundnut was said to contain aflatoxin while palm oil contained a colouring agent found to be carcinogenic.<br /><br />Government concern over these anomalies was reinforced by the fact that many agencies were charged with the responsibility of ensuring that agricultural commodities exported from Nigeria meet the required standards and quality by having them properly checked and certified. The agencies include the Nigerian Ports Authority (NPA), Nigerian Customs Service (NCS), Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria (FAAN), and NAFDAC. Others are Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC), Nigerian Agricultural Quarantine Service (NAQS), Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), and National Agricultural Seed Council (NASC). While Ogbe’s anger is understood, it is expected that appropriate proactive steps will be taken to see to it that government efforts to boost agriculture do not end a pipe-dream.<br /><br />It is reassuring that government is determined to institute synergies between rural and urban dwellers by addressing the yawning infrastructure gap that has plagued developmental efforts. The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development is fast-tracking SME development leveraging on the fast-growing pace of the agricultural sector. The Economic Recovery and Growth Plan (ERGP), a blueprint of government’s strategic plan towards diversifying and repositioning the economy on the path of sustainable growth, has Agriculture as one of its pillars.<br /><b><br /></b><b>By Sam Diala,</b><br /><b>Leadership News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Dangote Employs Youth Graduates for Rice Farming in Kogi",
    "content": "A multi-million Naira Youth Farming Initiative that will engage teeming unemployed Nigerian graduates in rice farming has been launched by the Dangote Rice Limited in Kogi State. Dangote This is as the company prepares to hit the market with one million metric tons of Dangote rice in 2018.<br /><br />The Dangote Youth Rice Farm project, mainly an out-grower scheme for youths only, was flagged off at the Lower Niger River Basin Authority, Kampe, Ejiba in Yagba West Local Government Area of the state where youths have embarked on rice cultivation over 100 hectares of land.<br /><br />The rice farm project, which was preceded by a special training for the youth farmers on the dynamics of rice farming, will see the youths cultivating the rice paddy on a 100 hectares of land, which will then be bought over by the company for processing.<br /><br />Under the scheme, the Dangote Rice Company provides the seedling, anti-pest-chemicals, and fertilizers while the Basin Authority provides the land for the young farmers. The management of Dangote Rice led by the Group Executive Director, Mr. Devakumar Edwin, flagged off the project while taking delivery of some rice paddy bags produced from the pilot project.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nq6RN5SPymY/WeR_8gh0WCI/AAAAAAAAAZc/YNxFnHqAxvA54GGQmEeKa9z42QjrmoRxQCLcBGAs/s1600/Dangote.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"297\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"237\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Nq6RN5SPymY/WeR_8gh0WCI/AAAAAAAAAZc/YNxFnHqAxvA54GGQmEeKa9z42QjrmoRxQCLcBGAs/s320/Dangote.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />Edwin explained that the project is a new dimension to the efforts by the pan-African conglomerate, the Dangote Group, at ensuring food security and creating job opportunities in Nigeria especially for the youths. He said the initiative is in line with the vision and commitment of Dangote Industries Limited to create a new generation of agri-preneur that will revolutionize the Nigerian agricultural sector.<br /><br />According to him: “We believe skill, knowledge, enabling environment, collaboration and linkages along the value chain are driving forces for economic empowerment and social development in line with the Federal Government policies. This project will address the skills gap in local rice production among unemployed youths by providing technical, organisational and financial requirements.<br /><br />It will also enhance domestic rice production to cover the large gap between demand and domestic production and to increase self-sufficiency of Nigeria and substitute imported rice by quality Nigerian rice brands.”<br /><br />Mr. Edwin disclosed that most modern rice mills in Nigeria presently operate at not more than 20% capacity utilization due mainly to lack of good quality paddy and that Dangote Rice aimed to change this situation developing and adapting out-grower schemes.<br /><br />According to him, the Dangote Rice Company plans to set up a 150,000 metric tons integrated rice mill and offer for sale one million mt of par boiled rice by 2018, saying “The second factor is the need to strengthen the on-going efforts at producing rice for self-sufficiency so that we can save foreign exchange.<br /><br />By the time we will be doing one million metric tons of rice next year, no less than three million jobs would been created along the value chain.” Mr. Edwin said the Kogi pilot project will cover four seasons of two years and will be launched in four other states soon. Speaking, Managing Director of Dangote Rice, Mr. Robert Coleman, urged the youth farmers to concentrate on the project and pay attention to details so that they would come out with good paddy yield.<br /><br /><b>By Victor Ahiuma-Young</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Africa Reinsurance Corporation, Africa Re, has disclosed that increased insurance penetration among farmers will help to drive the federal government’s agricultural transformation agenda. In an interview on the sideline of the 2017 Nigerian Economic Summit, Mr. Ken Aghoghovbia, Chief Operating Officer/Deputy Managing Director, African Re, also stated that insurance will help achieve the financial inclusion agenda of the government.<br /><br />Aghoghovbia said the company, working in conjunction with the World Bank, is partnering with the federal government to provide insurance services to local players, particularly in providing more cover to farmers. He explained that the aim is to deepen insurance penetration among farmers through the introduction of affordable insurance packages.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ISX6NWM7bI4/WeRsSCby62I/AAAAAAAAAZM/4PxJaHQrVSA9-S2YRg4qWVJHJ88vSjRqwCLcBGAs/s1600/insurance-pix.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"265\" data-original-width=\"400\" height=\"212\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-ISX6NWM7bI4/WeRsSCby62I/AAAAAAAAAZM/4PxJaHQrVSA9-S2YRg4qWVJHJ88vSjRqwCLcBGAs/s320/insurance-pix.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>He said, “If farmers are paying lower premium, many of them would take agriculture insurance, and if they have it, in case of any catastrophe in their business, they would be able to weather any storm and continue in their business. They would be in a position to pay back any credit facilities.<br /><br />“Many of them need funds to expand their business, but credit would hardly come if there is no guarantee that they would payback, especially in the face of catastrophe.&nbsp; &nbsp;This is one area that we are closely working with the World Bank and helping drive the Federal Government growth agenda.”<br /><br />On the role of insurance in driving financial inclusion in Nigeria, Aghoghovbia explained that it is open knowledge that of the top 10 insurance market in Africa, Nigeria has the least penetration rate, adding that there is a lot of room for growth in the sector. He argued that most of the insurance activities in Nigeria are focused on government and the corporate segment, while the retail segment is largely neglected. “That is why you find the petty trader in a market, whenever there is a fire incident that is the end for some of them.&nbsp; <br /><br />That is why you find the small farm holders, whenever there is drought; they are not able to continue,” he averred. He further stated that many of the smallholder farmers and small businesses are unable to upscale their operations because they lack access to capital.<br /><br />According to him, “With insurance, the smallholder farmers or the petty trader do not need a house or some other form of collateral security to have access to loan, because insurance can play that role.” Aghoghovbia maintained that with insurance, smallholder farmers can also have hope, adding that should there be any eventuality, there is sustainability, as the farmer can grow and not be affected.<br /><br /><b>By Favour Nnabugwu</b><br /><b>Vanguard News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Investing in climate-resilient agriculture not only improves food security but contributes to eradicating malnutrition, according to new report from the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD).<br /><br />The Nutrition Advantage – Harnessing the Nutrition Co-benefits of Climate Resilient Agriculture, a study of IFAD’s experience in improving nutrition in climate-sensitive agricultural investments, shows that climate change impacts in agriculture and the prevalence of malnutrition in rural areas are deeply intertwined.<br /><br />For those living on land that is increasingly degraded, or at risk due to greater climate variability, what is grown is not as rich in nutritious content as it could be, which has implications for rural and urban populations alike,” said IFAD President Gilbert F. Houngbo The research also points to the urgent need to sensitize farmers to spending their hard-earned income on more nutritious food choices which lead to better health outcomes for the whole family. Income-raising activities are also crucial to allow families to buy the food they do not grow themselves. Paired with nutrition education, the report shows the positive economic and nutritional benefits of a diversified approach.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-01qQF3-bRjI/WeRkLsFhLxI/AAAAAAAAAYk/BprJ5NFhrf8jfI6RUOniwTyfvTgjHw_aQCLcBGAs/s1600/IFAD.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"199\" data-original-width=\"254\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-01qQF3-bRjI/WeRkLsFhLxI/AAAAAAAAAYk/BprJ5NFhrf8jfI6RUOniwTyfvTgjHw_aQCLcBGAs/s1600/IFAD.jpg\" /></a></div><br />“Promoting diversified, climate-smart food systems that take nutritional considerations into account can help smallholders to be more resilient, provide more stable incomes and improve dietary quality, while at the same time addressing climate change,” said Margarita Astralaga, Director of IFAD’s Environment and Climate Division.<br /><br />The report points to examples of where IFAD is working on exactly this kind of multiple benefit investment. In Sudan, an IFAD-supported project on irrigation and land and water governance offered training on nutrition and food processing. Among the outcomes, women taking part learned about the nutritional benefits of less commonly consumed foods, such as vegetables, eggs and milk. They also learned how to prepare more nutritious dishes, the importance of good hygiene, as well as the benefits of a balanced diet. In Niger, in response to a harsh climate and land degradation, the IFAD-supported Family Farming Development Programme works with women’s groups to increase the availability of staple foods during the lean season and the production of foods with high nutritional value. Activities such as grain stores for women and “nutrition gardens,” are emphasized to help promote resilience to climate shocks.<br /><br /><b>Source: Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "How to Make Money From Quail Farming",
    "content": "Quail farming can be a lucrative business like other farming ventures, such as chicken, turkey or duck farming in Nigeria. But rearing of quail is still an uncommon business in the country because the bird is one of the smallest poultry birds.<br /><br />Ironically, just few people are into the business of the ‘little wonder bird’, as many people called it, and making cool cash and smiling to their banks. This set of people are also enjoying both the nutritional and health values derived from consuming the meat and the eggs of the bird. It is on records that some farmers are making between N700,000 and N1.3 million every year from raising quail birds for meat, eggs and hatchery production.<br /><br />Due to its nutritional values and health benefits, experts predicted that quail would soon take over the chicken poultry business.&nbsp; Starting quail farming requires a little capital of N20,000. The low cost of investment of rearing quail and the high rate of returns are some of the reasons farmers are venturing into quail farming.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ne7P3o4osQE/WeRisAqElTI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/r_VvcrmHUIc7tn-Ljx_R8YHIqQuJPFXMQCLcBGAs/s1600/quail-300x166.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"166\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ne7P3o4osQE/WeRisAqElTI/AAAAAAAAAYQ/r_VvcrmHUIc7tn-Ljx_R8YHIqQuJPFXMQCLcBGAs/s1600/quail-300x166.jpg\" /></a></div><br />Without expensive items, a potential farmer can start with N20, 000, which means the farmer can kick-start with five males and 25 females depending on the age and specie. The birds can be reared in cages and small floor space. But sometimes, experts advise that potential farmers should always consider cages to rear their birds because it is more efficient than that of floor space.<br /><br />Interestingly, quails take about five to six weeks to mature and their meat is highly recommended for people keen on boosting their immunity. Their eggs are wonderful super-food that can treat various ailments, which makes it more profitable to keep quails, as they are less demanding than chicken.<br /><br />Presently, a kilogramme of chicken meat goes for N700 on average in Nigeria, quail, which hardly weighs half–a–kilogrammes at maturity attracts N800. The little wonder bird has the ability to lay over 300 eggs in a year and one egg costs N30 to N40 because of the health benefits, which include, treatment of anaemia, arthritis, gastritis, removal of toxins and heavy metals from the blood; strong anti-cancer effects, and may help inhibit cancerous growth, nourish the prostate gland and may help restore sexual potency in men, enhance good memory and brain activity, slow down ageing of organs and the eggs are used for facial masks and hair care.<br /><br />Its major nutrition are Vitamin B-12 (Cobalamine) 0.14 µg (5.83 per cent), Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin) 0.071 mg (5.46 per cent), Selenium, Se 2.9 µg (5.27 per cent), Vitamin B5 (Pantothenic acid) 0.158 mg (3.16 per cent) among others.<br /><br />A quail egg, even with their small size, is packed with vitamins and minerals and its nutritional value is three to four times greater than that of chicken egg. If children eat at least two eggs of quail daily, they grow better and are less likely to suffer from infectious diseases.<br /><br />Feeding quails has never been a headache for farmers because a quail eats 20 grammes of food per day and hardly requires any drugs unlike a mature chicken-hen that consumes an average of 150 grammes of food per day and requires a regular administration of drugs.<br /><br />Before venturing into this profitable business, potential farmers have to prepare an effective business plan.&nbsp; A perfect quail farming business plan should include almost everything related to this business such as your production purpose, products you want to produce, housing, feeding, breeding, health care and marketing.<br /><br />Speaking with Daily Sun, the owner of FeedPlus, Sani Abdul, said there are varieties of quails one can rear. They include Bobwhite Quail, Button Quail, California Quail, Japanese Quail, Mountain Quail, Gambel’s Quail, Scaled Quail and Mearn’s Quail. He said the Japanese quail is more medicinal, which is common in Nigeria.<br /><br />On their feeding, he said: “when we talk about poultry feed, all of them are the same. The different is the poultry content just like we have layers, growers and starters etc. quail can be fed with poultry feed but it depends on the stage they are. The only difference is marsh because quails are smaller birds. If you want to grind their feed, it has to be softer”. You know chickens are bigger than quail. If you are using chicken formula to grind quails feed, it has to be re-ground in order to be soft. If you are using quail formulated formula.”<br /><br />He said the market for quail is available because Nigeria has the population except farmers don’t know how to do their marketing.&nbsp; He added that quail is one of the easiest birds to raise.<br /><br />He explained: “making cash with quails is not tough. They are straightforward to worry for and their products are straightforward to plug. In fact, raising dozen of quails in your backyard could be a good way to supplement your income, The basic business for creating cash with quails involves you purchasing baby quails from a hatchery and raising them till they are either laying eggs or mature for meat production. You will get additional profit by selling baby quails and compose quails manure.<br /><br /><b>By Steve Agbota&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Sun News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

We are at loss to understand why your bank, a Federal Government Agency, will not join hands with others to find a solution to this national dilemma.<br /><br />“In consideration of the foregoing, we request your bank and officials to stay actions on the contents of letters sent to our members pending the outcome of a proposed meeting involving the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources, NCAMPA and BOI where all issues are to be discussed and ironed out on mutually beneficial terms.”<br /><br />Regardless, the association stated that “the Bank of Industry (BOI) never responded or replied any of the letters dated 27th July, 2016 and 5th September, 2017 written to them.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Source: This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

Topping the list is the high cost of poultry feed, which constitutes about 75 per cent of the cost of production. In poultry feed, we use mainly grains like maize, soya bean, and groundnut.<br /><br />“This year, a tonne of maize sold for as high as N160,000 as against N50,000 in some countries. Soya bean is being sold at about N135,000 per tonne as against N80,000 in some countries. You can see that the cost of producing an egg in Nigeria is higher.<br /><br />“We would like the Federal Government to encourage maize growers to replicate the kind of arrangement it has with rice farmers. Maize farmers also deserve attention.<br /><br />“The poultry industry alone consumes over two million metric tonnes of maize per annum and about one million metric tonnes of soya bean. The government can help in providing high-yielding seeds, fertilisers and equipment to the maize and soya bean farmers.

    "content": "The Federal Government’s goal is to achieve 500,000 million metric tons (mt) of cocoa through the rehabilitation of old plantations, expansion programmes and best agricultural practices. Some development partners have joined the government‘s&nbsp; campaign&nbsp; to&nbsp; restore Nigeria to its past glorious position&nbsp; through&nbsp; empowerment programmes, reports&nbsp; DANIEL ESSIET.<br /><br />When President Muhammadu Buhari urged cocoa stakeholders to step up efforts towards repositioning the industry, he did this because the country&nbsp; had&nbsp; lost its place among cocoa producing countries.<br /><br />Buhari, who was represented by the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Mr Audu Ogbeh, at the first International Cocoa Summit at the Nicon Luxury Hotel, Abuja,&nbsp; in August, lamented Nigeria’s fall from fourth to seventh position in cocoa production.<br /><br />He described the situation&nbsp; as unfavourable to the nation’s economic growth.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YfDAg4z36pY/WeDDFfaJQ1I/AAAAAAAAAW8/KuQzeI20m4kbOxqtA5mjs759wW-zdRfpACLcBGAs/s1600/Cocoa-farmers-in-Ondo.JPEGIK.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"350\" data-original-width=\"600\" height=\"186\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-YfDAg4z36pY/WeDDFfaJQ1I/AAAAAAAAAW8/KuQzeI20m4kbOxqtA5mjs759wW-zdRfpACLcBGAs/s320/Cocoa-farmers-in-Ondo.JPEGIK.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>He said:&nbsp; “Cocoa is the second largest foreign exchange earner for Nigeria after crude oil, and has generated over two million jobs directly and indirectly along its value chain. The sector has suffered neglect as a result of over reliance on crude oil. This led to a decline in the country’s annual production from 420 metric tonnes in the 60s to 192, 000 metric tonnes in 2015. The country is long overdue to make the shift from being primarily an exporter of commodities and raw materials to becoming an industrial economy.”<br /><br />The President called for a return to the use of the hitherto abandoned Nigerian Industrial Revolution Plan (NIRP) launched by the previous&nbsp; administration in 2014, to revive the sector. Nigeria was a leading producer and exporter of cocoa. Until some time in the 1970s, it held an enviable record.<br /><br />Revenue&nbsp; from cocoa helped to sustain the livelihoods of not only farmers, but the entire citizenry, as proceeds were used to build roads, schools and health facilities. But the story is different today. Ageing trees, poor soil quality, and a younger generation in danger of disengaging from cocoa production represent an imminent threat to an industry that had struggled to develop significant productivity-per-hectare.<br /><br />The changing weather and poor incentives to farmers combined to reduce cocoa yields from that period to the present day. Today,&nbsp; the industry is seriously challenged. But, in spite of this, a huge market exists for raw and processed cocoa and its derivatives, locally and internationally.<br /><br />Analysts say the global market for chocolate and cocoa beverages is worth over $200 billion yearly. According to them, the beans are the goldmine of the cocoa plant because they are processed into cocoa liquor, cocoa butter, cocoa powder, and chocolate.<br /><br />Markets for Nigeria’s cocoa exist in European countries, such as Netherlands, France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States (US) where demands for chocolate are high.<br /><br />All hopes are not lost as&nbsp; industry&nbsp; partners have commenced moves to revitalise the industry. One of them is the UK’s Department for International Development (DFID), which has mapped out strategies to empower cocoa farmers.<br /><br />The intervention is being carried out through its Market Development in the Niger Delta (MADE) platform, designed to build Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) at farmers’ level through relevant and accessible training initiatives, which improve&nbsp; efficiency, ‘bankability’, and sustainability of food production.<br /><br />MADE is partnering Syngenta, an international biotechnology company, that has been involved in key transformation projects in agriculture.<br /><br />The partners are&nbsp; working with cocoa farmers on good agricultural practice, post-harvest solutions and market linkages.<br /><br />Right now, pests and diseases are a big problem for cocoa farmers. It is estimated that approximately 30 to 40 per cent&nbsp; of all potential cocoa production is lost to diseases and&nbsp; pests globally.&nbsp; Cocoa farmers face a variety of fungal diseases and insects/pests, which attack the leaves, stems and pods.<br /><br />These include black pods, witches’ broom, frosty pod, pod borer and brown cocoa mirid.<br /><br />Indeed, tackling these pests and diseases has been an issue for some farmers, who lack adequate knowledge on responsible pesticides usage.<br /><br />This has affected the fortunes of some of the farmers as European Union (EU), a big&nbsp; export market for the produce, insists on limited and proper pesticides use.<br /><br />But there are chemicals permitted for use on cocoa, which meet EU’s requirements. These are what some development partners are trying to promote.<br /><br />At a cocoa stakeholders and farmers’ field-day event, organised by Syngenta Nigeria Limited, in Adejubu, Araromi Igbatoro and Akure North of Ondo State, the company promised to supply cocoa farmers with a new non-copper fungicide called ‘Pergado’, to combat copper based fungicide diseases.<br /><br />Pergado, which is already in use in Côte d’Ivoire, has been approved by the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria (CRIN).<br /><br />Syngenta Nigeria Limited Country Director, Sunny Ameh,&nbsp; said the organisation had in the past three years trained over 16,000 smallholder cocoa farmers across states with support from MADE Project.<br /><br />Ameh said Pergado is a copper free product used to combat blackpod and other fungal diseases affecting cocoa production, with the potency to fight copper based fungicide diseases. He added that once farmers experience the efficacy of the product, they will have an edge on cocoa producing farmers in other countries.<br /><br />He added that Syngenta is committed to supporting cocoa industry revival in the country in order to reclaim its position as the top cocoa producing country in the world.<br /><br />He said: “Syngenta has been working with development partners&nbsp; such as MADE in Ondo in agric input value chain, promoting the adoption of new technologies, delivering higher yield, and training farmers to develop the right skills.<br /><br />“Our partnership with MADE in the Niger Delta is so unique in the sense that it has helped us to reach more farmers at the grassroot. We are helping farmers to engage superior and best practices that are of benefits to them and helping them to achieve much more from their traditional practices.”<br /><br />MADE Team Leader, Olatunde Oderinde, believed empowering the farmers was an important way to free&nbsp; them from poverty and hunger.<br /><br />He said: “MADE wants to see more ownership from our famers. We want our farmers to take ownership of our work with Syngenta. We want the farmers to lead the pilots in the field.”<br /><br />Oderinde said his organisation is looking forward to partnering government and cocoa farmers to make the business successful.<br /><br />Some farmers, who attended the event, expressed optimism about using Pergado.<br /><br />They expect the chemical to help limit losses of about 25 to 45 per cent often experienced by cocoa farmers owing to diseases.<br /><br />Highlights of the event featured a field tour of some cocoa plantations for product testing.<br /><br />Director/Head, Cocoa Research, CRIN, Dr&nbsp; Rasheed Adedeji, said the decision by the institute to certify Pergado, is hinged on the quality of the chemical and its potency of taming diseases, especially the cocoa black pod disease which is very aggressive in wet and humid conditions and spread mainly by rain splash.<br /><br /><b>By: Daniel Essiet</b><br /><b>The Nation News</b><br /><div><br /></div><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "Farmers, especially those on large-scale, are keeping away from their farms owing to the activities of kidnappers, consequently posing threat to commercial farming in Nigeria, Daily Trust reports.<br /><br />There are many large scale farmers across the country with hundreds of hectares of land engaged in both crop and livestock farming.<br /><br />However, the increased incidence of kidnapping in some parts of the country, particularly in the North, are at present threatening commercial farming as the owners are specifically becoming the target of kidnappers.<br /><br />A chief executive officer of an integrated farm along Jere-Kagarko Road in Kaduna State said owners of commercial farms were becoming the target of kidnappers, which he said was forcing them away from their farms.<br /><br />The CEO, whose farm sits on about 250 hectares, told Daily Trust that there was an attempt to kidnap him on his way to the farm.<br /><br />He said, thereafter, one of his staff was kidnapped at the farm and he had to pay N2m as ransom before he was freed.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Ya7xNzzUg8/Wd362ZQ8HNI/AAAAAAAAASw/nsgYSQmqSc01iINx625d4CZLnnrKf8VEQCLcBGAs/s1600/Agro%2BRangers.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-7Ya7xNzzUg8/Wd362ZQ8HNI/AAAAAAAAASw/nsgYSQmqSc01iINx625d4CZLnnrKf8VEQCLcBGAs/s320/Agro%2BRangers.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>“Since then, I ran away from the farm and I even contemplated shutting down the farm but still considered the huge investment I have made on it,” he said.<br /><br />His integrated farm cultivates crops like maize, ginger and soybeans. It also has a 250,000-capacity fish pond.<br /><br />He also rears goats and sheep and has about 50,000 laying birds in his poultry.<br /><br />The CEO hailed the move by the Federal Government to set up agro-rangers even as he further called on government to consolidate security presence along the Bwari-Jere-Kaduna Road.<br /><br />Daily Trust reports that police presence has improved along the road.<br /><br />Also, the managing director of another farm on the Abuja-Keffi Express Way told Daily Trust that he ordered the closure of the farm five months ago due to the activities of kidnappers.<br /><br />He said apart from several threats to his life and the lives of some of his workers, the hoodlums sometimes ago invaded the farm and rustled about 160 cows.<br /><br />The farmer, whose farm sits on 124 hectares, said prior to the closure of the farm, he cultivated about 160,000 heaps of yam, which yielded a bumper harvest last year, and that he cultivated watermelon too.<br /><br />“I farm all-year round because I have irrigation facilities, but my family advised me to stop going to the farm because of the activities of kidnappers and because of trust: you can’t just leave your investment in the hands of your workers, and even at that, what if they kidnap any of them and start demanding big money, where will I get the money? That was why I thought I should just close down the farm until the situation improves,” he said.<br /><br />The MD further said he advised his farmer friends to do same because of their safety. He, therefore, urged government to be serious about the security situation in the country.<br /><br />Another commercial farmer at a village outside Bwari in the FCT also disclosed how he narrowly escaped being kidnapped on his way to farm some weeks ago.<br /><br />The farmer, who combines cultivation of crops with animal husbandry, said as he was moving to the farm along the Jere-Bwari Road, some hoodlums opened fire on his jeep, adding that since then he had not stepped into the farm.<br /><br />“I have not been to the farm since then; who knows what is happening to my animals and crops there. Sometimes you don’t trust some of these staff; you need to be going there to see things yourself,” he said.<br /><br />He described the situation as worrisome and also called on government to address the situation.<br /><br />Also, most of the more than a dozen large scale farms on the Kaduna- BirninGwari road have been abandoned by their owners since the road became security-challenged for the last few years.<br /><br />Farm owners along the axis described the situation as worrisome.<br /><b><br /></b><b>Farmers, foreign investors scared – Dangote</b><br /><br />President of Dangote Group, AlhajiAlikoDangote, recently raised alarm that kidnappers were scaring away not only commercial farmers, but foreign investors also.<br /><br />Dangote, who spoke through his company’s Executive Director on Stakeholder Relations and Corporate Communication, Mansur Ahmed, at the just concluded NABG AgrikExpo and Conference, said kidnappers were forcing farmers to abandon their farms.<br /><br />Dangote said: “I know a large number of people who used to have farms between Abuja and Kaduna: most of them have stopped farming because quite a few of them have been abducted. I know at least half a dozen people who have farms in that area who have been kidnapped.”<br /><br />The National President of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Architect Kabiru Ibrahim, described the issue of kidnapping as a serious problem.<br /><br />“I go through a lot of problems here. If I am going to Abuja, when I arrive, my family will call to find out if I arrived well, and my people in Abuja, when I go back to Kaduna, also call me to know if I had arrived safely,” he said.<br /><br />A Professor of Agricultural Economics at the Nigerian Institute of Social and Economic Research (NISER) in Ibadan, Aderibigbe Olomola, said the Abuja-Kaduna axis had become notorious for kidnapping, a trend which, he said, affected not only farming activities, but all other businesses in the area.<br /><br />He said large-scale farmers were not necessarily targeted because they were just farmers but because they were rich.<br /><br />He said kidnapping was a general social problem and, therefore, charged government to develop infrastructure in the domain of farming: the rural areas.<br /><br />Oseni Yusuf of the Agricultural Economics and Rural Sociology Department, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaria, said the impact of kidnapping of commercial farmers was great, including its negative impact on income generation, standard of living and that it had health consequences on the families of affected farmers.<br /><br /><b>How to apply for Agro Rangers</b><br /><br />The Federal Government, through the Ministry of Agriculture, said efforts were being intensified to address the ugly scenario.<br /><br />The Director, Minister’s Office at the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development (FMARD), Mr. Victor Mayomi, said to safeguard heavy investment in the agricultural sub-sector, a security group called agro-rangers had been set up with over 3,000 personnel to guard agric investments.<br /><br />He said the agro-rangers constituted a unit within the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC).<br /><br />In an interview with Daily Trust, the Head of the Agro-Rangers Unit, AdamuSoja, an Assistant Comptroller General, confirmed that the scheme had started with over 3,000 personnel.<br /><br />He said the corps had already deployed personnel to safeguard a multipurpose farm in Sokoto, adding that the unit had also received applications from farmers, which he said were being speedily processed.<br /><br />ACG Soja advised interested farm owners and other agric investors to write request letters to the Comptroller General of the NSCDC, from where the Agro-Rangers Unit would get directives for immediate processing.<br /><br />“Once the unit receives the letter, if the security situation of such farm demands urgent attention, I will first direct our nearest command to deploy personnel to the farm pending my security assessment visit to such farm,” he said.<br /><br />He further said the security assessment visit would eventually determine the number of personnel and the nature of the security gadgets to be deployed to the farm, adding that the size of the farm and the security situation would determine the number of personnel that would be approved.<br /><br />ACG Sojasaid the scheme was absolutely free anywhere in the country, but that farm owners might provide accommodation for the personnel deployed to them.<br /><br />“Based on our security assessment, we may also ask the farm owners to build perimeter fences. This is to make patrol easier for our men,” he added.<br /><br />He said upon request, agric investments of any nature would benefit from the scheme, stressing that the process was simple, fair and fast.<br /><br /><b>By Hussein Yahaya&nbsp;&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu&nbsp; Ogbeh,&nbsp; has charged farmers and agro-processors dealers to mainstream the issue of food safety in their agricultural production as Nigerians deserve good, safe and quality agro-outputs for consumption and to meet world standards and international best practices.<br /><br />He gave the charge in his keynote address at the south-west nationwide advocacy on agricultural quality control and standardisation across the six geopolitical zones held in Lagos.<br /><br />“There is no better time than now to mainstream food safety into agricultural production if we want to really diversify our economy using agriculture as a veritable tool and have our own share of the export at both regional and international markets.<br /><br />Nigerians also deserve good, safe and quality agro-outputs for consumption and should be globally accepted like their counterparts across the globe” the Minister stated.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

Quarantine&nbsp; services, Dr. Vincent Isegbe, noted that previous efforts of the ministry had hitherto been geared towards increased cultivation and output per unit area with less emphasis&nbsp; on quality and standards of agro- produce, stating that the ban on dry beans from Nigeria by the European Union had now shifted attention to standards and quality in order to avoid incidences of communicable diseases in&nbsp; the country more so to earn&nbsp; foreign earnings that will boost the Nigerian economy.<br /><br />He said the nationwide advocacy&nbsp; on quality control&nbsp; and standardization of agricultural&nbsp; commodities was to target&nbsp; farmers and other&nbsp; stakeholders along&nbsp; the food value&nbsp; chain so as to inculcate the culture of agro- quality among key policymakers in both public and private institutions&nbsp; and to recognise the essential role of food safety in the production, preparation, manufacturing, packaging ,distribution, storage,sale of food and food products as well as agro produce&nbsp; export promotion.<br /><br />The Minister maintained that as part of government’s&nbsp; initiative to aid aggregation, certification standardisation and traceability, commodities certification&nbsp; centres would be established across the six geopolitical zones of the country.<br /><br />He commended stakeholders for their efforts in stemming the negative trend and for being agents of change towards quality consumption and zero rejection of Nigeria’s agro- produce.<br /><br />The&nbsp; Governor of Lagos state, Mr Akinwumi Ambode in his opening speech said&nbsp; the state would continue to align herself with the Federal governments’ vision of making agriculture a revenue Base of the country.<br /><br />The governor who was represented by its&nbsp; commissioner&nbsp; for Agriculture, Oluwatoyin Suarau highlighted several initiatives and achievements recorded by the state to grow&nbsp; the nation’s agricultural sector&nbsp; which include state,s collaboration&nbsp; with kebbi state on rice processing, Lake rice; empowerment scheme;fisheries and aquaculture development; Lagos state coconut development authority among others.<br /><br />The Minister of industry, trade and investment, Dr Okechkwu&nbsp; Enelamah who was represented by the director, Federal produce inspectorate, Mr Akabueze Michael urged stakeholders at the workshop to leverage the knowledge gained to achieve zero reject of the country’s agro-product.<br /><br />In a goodwill message,the Managing Director, Nigeria Ports Authority, Hadizah Bala Usman who was represented by Mr Innocent Umar said her organisation was ready&nbsp; to assist in transforming Nigeria from dependence on oil dollar to agro- dollar, adding that NPA had dedicated some port terminals in Lagos such as Ikorodu and lily pond terminals as export terminals .<br /><br />The nationwide advocacy train which is in the South West, Lagos state, took off in North West Kano state followed by North Central in Benue state, south-east in Enugu state and will proceed to the south-south and North East zones at&nbsp; later dates.<br /><br />Part of highlights of the event was the presentation of intervention materials by the Minister of Agriculture to support Nigerian farmers.<br /><br />The intervention materials included magnetic net, aflansafe kits, tomato crates and moisture meters.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife&nbsp;</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "As the need arises for the adoption of technology for increased plant yield and achievement of self sufficiency in food production in Nigeria, stakeholders in the seed subsector met in Abuja for sensitisation on the developments surrounding Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).<br /><br />The meeting which brought together seed companies, seed regulatory body, biotechnology regulatory body and scientists, became necessary following the plans by scientists to release BT Cotton and BT Cowpea by next year to farmers which have been genetically engineered.<br /><br />The sensitisation workshop was organised by the African Agriculture Technology Foundation (AATF), Open Forum on Agriculture Biotechnology (OFAB), National Biotechnology Development Agency (NABDA) and others.<br /><br />Speaking during the programme, the Director General National Agriculture Seed Council (NASC), Dr Phillip Ojo, said the workshop was necessary to educate stakeholders on the advancement in agriculture which bothers on seeds.<br /><br />According to him “This meeting is very important for us as a country; it is a meeting that focuses on educating stakeholders on recent developments and technological advancements in agriculture particularly as it relates to biotechnology and GMOs.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

n the position of government on GMOs.<br /><br />“We all know that from the four domain of biotechnology enumerated, it is Agric-biotech that is most controversial; while the main output of this are GM seeds.<br /><br />“But in as much as all traded seeds are products of research and we have been coping with them, GM seeds will only challenge our increased sensitivity to prompt taking note of unusual observations on the Seed fields and instant reporting to the appropriate institution.<br /><br />“Without prejudice to any mandate or activities of any institution, it is obvious that lack of capacity by our public institutions to domesticate technology to suit local needs remains the bane and retards our national development.<br /><br />“Ideally, it is expected of the NASC to intimate the Seed companies on every government position as restated to agriculture, policy changes and innovations so that our participation and involvement can be well mapped out”, Olafare noted.<br /><br /><b>By: Collins Nnabuife</b><br /><b>Tribune News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Nigeria is said to be losing huge foreign exchange revenues and about four million jobs annually due to the country’s failure to fully maximise the benefits of a United States’ duty-free trade policy, the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA).<br /><br />The scheme was signed into law on May 18, 2000 by the former American President, Mr. Bill Clinton, to assist the economies of sub-Saharan Africa and improve economic relations between the US and the region.<br /><br />After its initial 15-year validity period, the success of the scheme in increasing trade volume and value between the United States and some African countries made former President Barack Obama to extend the implementation by 10 years to 2025.<br /><br />Through AGOA, Nigeria can export 6,500 products duty free into the United States, an opportunity unprecedented considering the huge market under consideration.<br /><br />Some of the products that Nigeria can leverage on are garlic, natural honey, potato, onion, tomato, cucumber, vegetables, cabbage, chicken, goats, and milk.<br /><br />Others include fish, eggs, peas, beans, corn, okra, kola nuts, guava, mango, oranges, lemons, grapefruits, papayas, rice, wheat and many more.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both;

    "content": "The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) and stakeholders in the renewed drive for economic diversification through agriculture have reiterated that agriculture presents the major opportunity of a long-term sustainable development in the country.<br /><br />CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, said with the current levels of unemployment in Nigeria, agriculture sector remained vital to the efforts of the Federal Government in diversifying the country’s monolithic economy away from oil.Emefiele, who made the observation at the weekend in Abuja, during the stakeholders’ meeting on the operational framework for the Accelerated Agricultural Development Scheme (AADS) initiated by President Muhammadu Buhari, also said the meeting was in efforts to consolidate the collective efforts of the monetary and fiscal authorities to diversify the country’s economy.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JItETt3H5Ps/WdssJ0YvX0I/AAAAAAAAAQs/CGQp1EFHw8k-CNkbYXa_5Biuets8f7HewCLcBGAs/s1600/Central-Bank-of-Nigeria-Headquarters-%2BCBN.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"718\" data-original-width=\"1276\" height=\"180\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JItETt3H5Ps/WdssJ0YvX0I/AAAAAAAAAQs/CGQp1EFHw8k-CNkbYXa_5Biuets8f7HewCLcBGAs/s320/Central-Bank-of-Nigeria-Headquarters-%2BCBN.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Meanwhile, the Bankers Committee said nation’s deposit money banks are now ready to disburse its pooled five per cent equity contributions at N26 billion, meant to support small businesses in the agriculture sector at concessional rates.<br /><br />The Chief Executive Officer, Unity Bank Plc, Mrs. Tomi Somefun, who spoke for the committee, affirmed that the special fund was set up to the tune of N26 billion to provide equity contributions to Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), particularly those in the agriculture sector.”We mentioned before that the framework for this was being developed. The Bankers committee can confirm that this is being finalised and disbursement will commence by the end of this fourth quarter.<br /><br />“To further support this the CBN has created a special export intervention scheme to support export and of course, that will generate additional foreign exchange. This will be closely monitored and we expect a lot of SMEs to benefit from this scheme.”The issue we had in the past was the failure of some exporters to repatriate the foreign exchange generated, and the CBN has agreed with the Bankers Committee to sanction defaulting exporters.<br /><br />But the Director of Banking Supervision Department at CBN, Alhaji Ahmed Abdullahi, added: “This export scheme is different from the Export Expansion Grant of the Federal Government. This one is a CBN initiative to boost exports, so that exporters can access the fund just like the Commercial Agricutural Scheme or the Anchor Borrowers Programme to boost their businesses.<br /><br />Similarly, the agriculture stakeholders meeting organised by CBN, which had the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, state governors, among others in attendance, was expected to significantly improve the agricultural output, drive economy growth, reduce unemployment among youth and increase national cohesion.<br /><br />While acknowledging the twin-challenge of youth restiveness and unemployment, the Emefiele stressed the need for stakeholders to confront the challenge with innovative thinking, using agriculture as a fulcrum of a long-term sustainable and profitable approach.Also speaking, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, Chief Audu Ogbeh, commended the courage of the CBN Governor, Godwin Emefiele, and his team, in introducing the policy on the restriction of access to foreign exchange for some 41 items, which can be produced in Nigeria.<br /><br />For Kebbi State Governor, Alhaji Atiku Bagudu, who doubles as the Head, Technical Sub-committee of AADS and Chairman of the Presidential Initiative on Rice and Wheat, commended the efforts of CBN in galvanizing rice production revolution through the Anchor Borrowers’ Programme.Bagudu appealed to Nigerians to support the AADS, noting that even industrialised nations have had to protect their agricultural production through tariffs and trade policy, especially in areas the country has comparative advantage.<br /><br /><b>By Chijioke Nelson</b><br /><b>Guardian News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Herdsmen/Farmers’ Clashes: Ogbeh Derserves Commendation Not Rebuke",
    "content": "The article – “Ogbeh’s illogic on herdsmen, farmers clashes” – published at page 70 of THISDAY Newspaper of Sunday, September 17, must have jolted many readers, knowing that Chief Audu Ogbeh, the Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development, is one of the few Cabinet Ministers in the Buhari administration that are rated highly for their achievements.<br /><br />Nigeria did not experience food shortages in the midst of a recession and acute shortage of foreign-exchange precipitated by the monumental looting by the immediate past administration and compounded by the sharp fall in the price of crude oil largely because of the efficient management of affairs in the Agriculture Ministry.<br /><br />The writer of this caustic article, Anayo Okolie, was angry that the Minister said at the National Conference on the Transformation of Nigerian Livestock Industry held in Abuja recently that planning and funding were needed to address the problem of frequent clashes between herdsmen and farmers. The question is: What can any Ministry or Government for that matter do without planning and funding through budgetary provision? Indeed, the National Conference on the Transformation of Nigerian Livestock Industry convened by the Federal Ministry of Agriculture is a strong indication of the eagerness of the Minister to find a lasting solution to a protracted crisis that past governments have failed to adequately resolve.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wxvJXm01UcU/WdsrTooIP8I/AAAAAAAAAQk/5PbIXam-KGo6EnFfiVtMNi0pcDad2IeFQCLcBGAs/s1600/Fulani-herdsmen1.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"444\" data-original-width=\"700\" height=\"202\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wxvJXm01UcU/WdsrTooIP8I/AAAAAAAAAQk/5PbIXam-KGo6EnFfiVtMNi0pcDad2IeFQCLcBGAs/s320/Fulani-herdsmen1.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>Anayo Okolie in his write-up quoted the Minister as having said the following at the conference, but curiously disregarded or failed to understand the nexus between the statements and the determination to tackle the root causes of the herdsmen/farmers crisis:-<br />“To solve this problem requires a great deal of planning and expenditure. You can’t think that after one meeting, then recommendations come, you want to solve the problem; you don’t have all the funds at once, because this is a problem that has been with us for quite a while, it’s just growing and getting worse.<br /><br />“The budget we have can’t cope. The state governors must be involved. Other stakeholders, who want to keep ranches, cattle must be here. If we don’t have the money, we ask the FAO, the World Bank or AfDB, because that is their job – to help us out. Then, we draw our design, do a costing and pass it on to them.<br />“The reason for this new approach is to put this matter before all Nigerians. It’s our problem. Quarrelling, hauling abuses at each other, raising suspicions, anger and all that will not help. We have a problem, we must solve it and solutions are not that difficult to find, which is why we have invited virtually everybody we think will help in providing solutions – state governors, experts, ministries, consultants, the World Bank, the FAO – we want to sit together and design a solution. A country which has at least 45 million hectares of empty land has no business allowing farmers and cattle rearers to fight,” he stated.<br /><br />It takes a lot of malice and prejudice to ignore the Minister’s statement and go ahead to attempt to ridicule him.<br />The atrocities committed by herdsmen around the country are well known and have been condemned. The Federal Government has directed security agencies to clamp down on the marauding herdsmen and many state governments are taking measures to protect their people from the excesses of the herdsmen.<br /><br />But the best solution to the lingering problem lies in addressing the root causes. It is a fact that when grazing areas shrink pastoralists compete over limited resources, increasing the potential for conflicts. Nigeria had a well-defined cattle route, supported by about 480 grazing reserves across the country. That’s almost all disappeared as states took control and put the land to other uses.<br /><br />The herdsmen, however, have not been adequately educated on these changes and they continue to move their animals along the old routes that have new owners. The heavy cattle traffic is sustained by the strong demand for beef. About 80,000 cows are slaughtered and consumed in Nigeria daily. Nigerian cattle rearers don’t have that much. Therefore there is a lot of cross-border activities by herdsmen from neighbouring countries in search of new grazing terrain and for trade. ECOWAS treaty allows such free movement across the borders. Some of the herdsmen may not even be Nigerians, all the more reason why the national conference was desirable.<br /><br />What many of us don’t know about the herdsmen is that they will be happy to stay in any location where they have adequate grass and water for their animals rather than taking risks roaming with their cattle in order to find fresh pastures on which to graze.<br />This underscores the wisdom in inviting state governors who are the custodians of land, and those who may develop ranches to the conference to talk with Food and Agricultural Organisation, the World Bank and African Development Bank to address the root causes of herdsmen/farmers clashes.<br /><br />It is disheartening that Anayo Okolie could willingly ridicule a person whom he himself acknowledged “many Nigerians have respect for” for proffering a solution to an intractable problem without suggesting any alternative, except of course that he feels the Federal Government should have treated the herdsmen the same way it is handling the IPOB members. At this point, the veil was off and one could sense Anayo’s bitterness. He is in fetters of bitterness and is indiscriminately throwing brickbats at the Buhari government.<br /><br />It is pertinent to mention that the Federal Government has taken measures to curtail the menace of herdsmen, but a lot still needs to be done. Developing grazing infrastructure that will guarantee the herdsmen pastures to feed the cattle in cattle colonies or ranches all year round will be a viable option as this reduces the need for livestock herding and roaming for the purpose of finding fresh pastures.<br /><br />On the other hand, secession is treason and cannot and should not be equated with the criminal acts of herdsmen. It has something in common with the insurgency of Boko Haram which seeks to carve its independent caliphate out of Nigerian territory; IPOB wants to create a Republic of Biafra out of Nigeria.<br /><br />One would have thought the type of comments by Anayo Okolie belong only on the internet where false and fake news thrive under anonymity, but to accommodate and dignify it in a reputable newspaper like THISDAY on Sunday, is to say the least unfortunate and disturbing. Anayo Okolie didn’t hide his motive when he fumed: “If the Federal Government could go all out to whip the Indigenous People of Biafra(IPOB) and its leader Nnamdi Kanu in line, what is difficult in reining in the herdsmen and farmers?” A Minister who brought together state governors, who are the custodians of land, representatives of the World Bank, Food and Agricultural Organisation and African Development Bank, representatives of farmers and herdsmen, relevant ministries and departments and experts to agree on a solution to the incessant clashes between herdsmen and farmers; a Minister who strongly feels that Nigeria which has at least 45 million hectares of empty land has no business allowing farmers and cattle rearers to fight should not be ridiculed, but commended for his patriotism.<br />–––Adikwu is a Media Consultant based in Abuja.<br /><br /><b>By: Innocent Adikwu</b><br /><b>This Day News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

This is despite the fact that cashew exporters this year increased annual volume meant for export to 170, 000 metric tons from 160,000 tons.<br /><br />Publicity Secretary, National Cashew Association of Nigeria (NCAN), Mr. Sotonye Anga said the farmers have cultivated more land with a view to boosting exports to raise annual earnings.

    "content": "On-farm demonstrations in Ogun State under the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture- managed Cassava Weed Management Project have produced average yields of 27 tonnes per hectare, surpassing the national average of about eight tonnes/ha.<br /><br />A statement from the IITA on Thursday noted that the demos were conducted in 2016 in the three senatorial districts of the state, using an integrated weed control package developed by the IITA-CWMP.<br /><br />The statement quoted a scientist at the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, Dr. Patience Olorunmaiye, while presenting the results during the Joint Quarterly Review Meeting of the project in Abeokuta, as saying that the yields from the demonstration plots were impressive and a proof of concept, adding that if farmers adopted improved weed management practices, they would be better off.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2ufaUdMUr8c/WdcysZOWGuI/AAAAAAAAAP4/d8p1k2m0234IMCQjT7Il2MZAPcrI1seJwCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmers-planting-seedlings.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"225\" data-original-width=\"300\" src=\"https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2ufaUdMUr8c/WdcysZOWGuI/AAAAAAAAAP4/d8p1k2m0234IMCQjT7Il2MZAPcrI1seJwCLcBGAs/s1600/Farmers-planting-seedlings.jpg\" /></a></div>The highest yield from the demonstration farms was 32 tonnes/ha with 96 per cent of the demonstration farms recording more than 20 tonnes/ha, the statement indicated.<br /><br />The Principal Investigator of IITA-CWMP, Prof. Friday Ekeleme, was quoted as saying that the results clearly showed that weeds were a major factor limiting the potential of cassava in Africa.<br /><br />The statement said, “In the last four years, the IITA-CWMP with funds from the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation made a bold decision to unravel the puzzle of weeds menace in cassava.<br /><br />“Working with a coalition of partners including the Federal University of Agriculture Abeokuta, University of Agriculture Makurdi, the National Root Crops Research Institute, and extension partners, the team set up trials in the three agro-ecological zones of the country: the humid forest, derived savannah and the southern guinea savannah.<br /><br />“These trials led to the selection of safe and environmentally friendly herbicides with other agronomic practices that formed the package that was used in setting up the demos in Ogun and other states of Nigeria (Abia, Benue and Oyo). Results from the other states are also being compiled for analysis.”<br /><br />&nbsp;Ekeleme said the results from Ogun State indicated that the project was achieving one of its major objectives, which was to double the national average yield of cassava, generate wealth, and reduce the burden of weeding in cassava farming systems.<br /><br />Grown by over 4.5 million people in Nigeria, cassava is a major staple contributing to food security and wealth of the nation. Although Nigeria is a major producer of the root crop, accounting for over 54 million tonnes per annum, average yield per ha is low with weeds being fingered as a major block.<br /><br /><b>By: Anna Okon</b><br /><b>Punch News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "title": "Meet Kebbi Girls on Agric Adventure",
    "content": "The girls are seen looking for rice from the harvested rice residues at a farm in Makera area of Birnin Kebbi<br /><br />They are mostly young girls whose ages range from 10 - 16 years. They are easily identified with the sticks they usually hold with which they re-trash harvested rice at the various farms around Dukku, Makera, Ambursa and Gwadangwaji areas of Birnin Kebbi. Their number often varies but at any given time they are not less than 20.<br /><br />Their mission is to move about the rice farms that have been harvested. When they get there, they divide the rice residues among themselves and re-trashed it to get some rice which they will take home to their parents.<br /><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D_taJxd1Ggg/WdZpnlAetTI/AAAAAAAAAKo/2ydStJ1IHJA84EJfQIyAPpUNr-d0Jd_AwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kebbi.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-D_taJxd1Ggg/WdZpnlAetTI/AAAAAAAAAKo/2ydStJ1IHJA84EJfQIyAPpUNr-d0Jd_AwCLcBGAs/s320/Kebbi.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div>When our correspondent ran into the energetic, determined and ambitious young girls who appear ready to work to find food for their families in the various murky and waterlogged rice farms around Kebbi State, Aisha Aliyu, 16, the most senior among her team told Daily Trust that what informed their food search adventure was to make sure their parents, particularly their mothers, do not starve.<br /><br />She said, “We don’t pay the farmers anything, we only come to the rice farms on their permission to search for rice, vegetables and other crops that we can take home to our parents.<br /><br />“We usually come to this farm settlement every year from Kalangu, Makera and other communities here in Birnin Kebbi. We are 21 in number and we always make sure that everyone in the group gets something to take home to their parents no matter how small it is.”<br /><br />Hadiza Batulu is a 13-year-old JSS1 student at Salamatu Husseni Government Girls’ Secondary School in Birnin Kebbi.&nbsp; Her area of food search at the farm is vegetables. The young Hadiza was gathering okra and other vegetables when this reporter met her.<br /><br />She said, “Apart from re-trashing rice residues at the farms, we ask for the permission of the farmers to plant ‘rama’ (kenaf) and sell the leaves for our economic well-being and to help the fertility of the farm.<br /><br />“We have through this means sustained our families’ economic needs. Some rice farmers on their own also plant ‘rama’ (kenaf) which they sometimes sell the leaves to us which also we sell to maintain our families.<br /><br />“There is nothing we do at the farms that the famers are not aware of. They realise we are only trying to help in maintaining our families so they always allow us in their farms,” Hadiza Batulu said.<br /><br />A farmer, Abdullahi Aminu, who spoke to our correspondent, said the food adventure of the girls was known to farmers in any part of the farm areas particularly in Birnin Kebbi.<br /><br />“We know them, they always come here to make a living from the left over in various farms. The good thing about them is that they will never enter into any farm without seeking permission from the farm owner.”<br /><br />Another farmer, Yahaya Sarki, stated that the girls are only interested in finding a means of livelihood for their families by gathering left over crops in the farms. He said some of their parents are either old or suffering from some illness which has made it difficult for them to go out in search of a living.<br /><br />“The girls are just determined and courageous. What do you think their parents would have survived on if they are not doing what they are doing?” Sarki said.<br /><b><br /></b><b>By Ismail Adebayo,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",

    "content": "<br />Rice harvest to begin in Benue State by the end of this month<br /><br />Rice farmers in Benue State are hoping for a bumper harvest in no distance time following their ability to effectively tackle the resurgence of army worm infestation on their farms.<br /><br />Most of the farmers lost their yield last year to the ravaging crop pests.<br /><br />But, with the application of appropriate pesticides and engagement of best agronomy practices, the rice farmers may have a success story to tell for this year’s harvest which is fast approaching.<br /><br />Mr. Vitalis Tarnongu, a rice farmer, said his harvest would be amazing because he ensured that the seed, which he got from a company in South Africa, was one of the best, coupled with the best agronomy practices he followed.<br /><br />He expects to reap 150 bags of rice from at least one hectare each of his large farms spread across different areas of the Federal University of Agriculture in Makurdi, Benue State, by the end of October.<br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-waRaivykRtY/WdY-7C60N3I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/NvEA_LZpvsUiZYnAM0x1y_yKNs6wgdNHQCLcBGAs/s1600/Rice.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"387\" data-original-width=\"660\" height=\"187\" src=\"https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-waRaivykRtY/WdY-7C60N3I/AAAAAAAAAJ0/NvEA_LZpvsUiZYnAM0x1y_yKNs6wgdNHQCLcBGAs/s320/Rice.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></a></div><br />“Apart from eliminating any trace of infestation, if our rice farmers can practice transplant of rice as I did, they will have more yield than from the old fashioned way of planting their rice,” Tarnongu said.<br /><br />For now, he is optimistic that the major challenge of rice farmers in the state is how to control weeds in their fields as most of them still lack the knowledge to do so. He also advised the state government to pay more attention to the agricultural sector for revenue generation in the face of dwindling oil economy.<br /><br />Tarnongu, who is also chairman, board of Directors of Teryima Nigeria Limited, explained that his company, which started as a farmers group in 2007 with few farmers who were into rice and maize production, now has a membership of over 300 farmers and is expanding its scope to cassava farming and carrying out agriculture business nationwide.<br /><br />“We strongly believe in agriculture and hereby advise the present and future administrations to pay more attention to it for revenue generation, self-reliance and economic growth of our state. We encourage others to embrace agriculture so that we can retain our status as the food basket of the nation,” he added.<br /><br />Another rice farmer at Ikpayongo in Gwer Local Government Area, Dennis Alfred, said he expected a bumper harvest from his five hectares of rice farm following the favourable weather condition this year.<br /><br />He opined that despite the flood that threatened his rice field at the initial stage, the plants have grown well, promising a robust harvest and beautiful income in a month’s time.<br /><br />Similarly, Anthony Anebi, whose rice farm covers about 100 hectares of land in Adoka District of Otukpo Local Government Area of the state, emphasised the need for support from government at all levels, noting that farmers in the state were set to meet the country’s consumption need.<br /><br />Anebi records at least 6.5 tons per hectare when rainfall is minimal and 7 tons per hectare with adequate rainfall, making him churn out over 70 bags of paddy at 100kg yearly even as he hoped to have more yield this year.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the State Chairman of All Farmers Association of Nigeria (AFAN), Comrade Aondona Hembe Kuhe, is concerned that most of the rice farms were affected by flood as such the general harvest would not be high as expected.<br /><br />Kuhe, however, noted that some rice farmers whose fields were not affected by the flood are expecting good yield, especially as the challenge of invading army worms which interrupted bumper harvest last season had been solved.<br /><br />According to him, the rice and soybean anchor borrower programme for this year targeted 20,000 farmers in the state, adding that more awareness was needed to increase the number of 4,000 beneficiaries which participated last year against the initial 15,000 farmers targeted during that season.<br /><br />The AFAN chairman expressed worry that the rice farmers engaged in the programme complained that their financial claims were yet to be cleared.<br /><br />He further appealed to unregistered farmers with AFAN in the state to acquaint themselves with the other 2,000 different cooperative members of the association in order to access loan facilities from the designated banks.<br /><br />On his part, Governor Samuel Ortom has consistently stressed the need for diversification of the nation’s economy from oil to agriculture and urged the people of the state to embark on dry season farming. He said the state government has entered into partnership with the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) to support farmers with massive land clearing, farm equipment and other inputs for mechanised farming.<br /><br />“With the dwindling oil prices, Nigerians must consider agriculture as a veritable alternative. We in Benue have already taken the initiative. I have told all members of the state executive council to individually encourage farming activities in their communities.<br /><br />“Throughout the year, we can do farming here. We have two rivers - Benue and Katsina-Ala rivers - so sourcing water to irrigate crops is not a problem,” Ortom had maintained.<br /><br /><b>By Hope Abah,</b><br /><b>Daily Trust News</b><div class=\"blogger-post-footer\">(c)AgricVentures Nigeria reserves all right to the Legal contect published on The Websites.</div>",
